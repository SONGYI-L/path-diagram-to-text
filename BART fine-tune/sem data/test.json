A has a relatively strong effect on I, but there is no reverse effect from I to A. Note also that N is slightly, but significantly, influenced by I and E but not by A. Indirectly, A has effects on N via E and I, but they are extremely small. E takes the most central position in the structure because it has feedback relationships with A and I and unidirectionally influences N."

In turn, strategic orientation improves the composition, structure and role of BOS. The clearly articulated composition, structure and role of BOS will enhance the university adaptability, which in turn results in balanced vibrant curriculum design. The vibrant curriculum design further improves the stakeholder feedback as it better caters to their needs. Vibrant curriculum design demands an improved or higher consistency in evaluation which will lead to more evaluation led faculty development. A well-defined, clearly articulated composition, structure and role of BOS are essential for the good health of the university. The composition structure and role of BOS will enhance the development of the students for much broader knowledge society. This in-turn will help to achieve consistency in evaluation and mission through curriculum design. The development of knowledge society has significant influence on curriculum design. The curriculum design improves the performance analysis. Through performance analysis, it enhances focussed environment scanning and assessment. This process of environmental scanning and assessment leads to focussed evaluation led faculty development, which in turn enhances the knowledge society. The broader perspectives of the knowledge society will further spread the horizon of the curriculum design."

To the participants in this study, a positive attitude towards computer use was a stronger driver than their perceived usefulness for the intention to use technology. Three other hypotheses were significant: perceived usefulness \u2192 attitude towards computer use (.42), perceived ease of use \u2192 perceived usefulness (.58), and perceived ease of use \u2192 attitude towards computer use (.34). It is noteworthy that, although perceived ease of use has a significant influence on attitude towards computer use, the former exerted a greater influence on perceived usefulness. Also, the influence on attitude towards computer use by perceived usefulness is stronger than that by perceived ease of use. It appeared in this study that the significance of perceived ease of use on attitude towards computer use was mediated by perceived usefulness."

However, the direction of the relationships differed between the two parental involvement factors. Parental home involvement was positively associated with academic performance. Parental school involvement was negatively associated with academic performance. Except for math cas, the negative relationships between parental school involvement and academic performance of youth were statistically significant. The positive relationships between parental home involvement and academic per formance of youth were all statistically significant. Fig. 2 illustrates the primary structural model, including the standardized path estimates. After examining all direct effects, parental home involvement had the largest significant positive effect size on English examination scores (0.139). The effect size of parental home involvement on English cas was similar (0.138). Further, parental school involvement had the largest significant negative effect size on English cas ( \u22120.112), followed by English examination score (\u22120.101). On average, the absolute value of effect sizes of parental home involvement on academic performance was slightly higher than the absolute value of effect sizes of parental school involvement."

Tourism planning (0.203) was positively related to support for tourism. As community attachment (0.117) increases, resident support for tourism also increases. The measurements for environmental sustainability and community participation were not statistically significant. Additionally, the paths from environmental sustainability, tourism planning, community participation and community attachment to positive impacts and negative impacts were tested. The statistical results in the structural model showed that environmental sustainability (\u22120.174), community participation (\u22120.199) and community attachment (0.300) are statistically significant to the perceived positive impacts."

Fashion involvement had a direct significant effect on fashion-oriented impulse buying behavior (0.62). Hedonic consumption tendency related significantly to positive emotions (0.37). However, there was a significant indirect effect for hedonic consumption tendency on fashion-oriented impulse buying via the mediating positive emotion. Positive emotion produced a positive effect on fashion-oriented impulse buying when shopping (0.23). This finding suggested that emotional states play an important role in decision making for impulse buying clothing.

The overall results of the structural analysis indicate that LMX has significant negative relationship with employee's turnover intention (0.251). Besides, the results of SEM show that LMX is positively related with individual feeling of energy (0.546) which is in turn, positively related to predict creative work involvement. Moreover, interpersonal relationship has shown a significant positive impact on turnover intention. First, the statistical results reveal that LMX has significant negative relationship with employee's turnover intention. Second, it was determined from the results that LMX is positively related with individual feeling of energy. Third, the research findings elaborate that individual feeling of energy is positively related with creative work involvement (0.534). Last, the results provide strong evidence that interpersonal relationship is positively related with turnover intention (0.215)."

High levels of SMS at T1 were predictive of high levels of VC at T2 (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.14). As the direct effect from CCB-T1 to VC-T2 is not statistically significant, it emerged that the relationship between CCB and VC is fully mediated by SMS."

The total variance explained in child mental health and quality of life were 0.33 and 0.45, respectively. Child mental health, parental support, and peer support showed strong total effects to quality of life. Parental support demonstrated an indirect relationship to quality of life via the child mental health."

Looking into relationships between latent variables, results proved the effect of sevice quality and customer satisfaction with a value of 0.844. Moreover, customer satisfaction significantly affected behavioral intention of the LRT users in the sample (estimate = 0.403). Additionally, service quality had a significant positive effect on behavioral intention (estimate = 0.276). With respect to the measurement of service quality, SQ1, SQ2 and SQ3 had the highest factor loads on this construct (estimates 0.783, 0.782, and 0.775, respectively). On the contrary, SQ8 showed the lowest factor load on service quality(estimate = 0.492)."

A weak association is apparent between the variables \u2018\u2018SDM\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Team interaction\u2019\u2019 (r = .18), while a moderate effect is found between \u2018\u2018SDM\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Empathy\u2019\u2019 (r = .39), and a strong effect between \u2018\u2018Team interaction\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Empathy\u2019\u2019 (r = .46). Moreover, the constructs \u2018\u2018SDM\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Team interaction\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Empathy\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Satisfaction with decision\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Patient cooperation\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Adherence\u2019\u2019 predict the variance of the constructs \u2018\u2018Patient satisfaction\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Treatment acceptance\u2019\u2019 at 61% and 67%, respectively. \u2018\u2018SDM\u2019\u2019 can be predicted by \u2018\u2018Satisfaction with decision\u2019\u2019 (18%) and \u2018\u2018Patient cooperation\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Adherence\u2019\u2019 can be predicted by \u2018\u2018Team interaction\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Empathy\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2018Satisfaction with decision\u2019\u2019 (22% and 11%, respectively). All direct paths from the construct \u2018\u2018Team interaction\u2019\u2019 to the criteria \u2018\u2018Patient satisfaction\u2019\u2019 (b = .34), \u2018\u2018Treatment acceptance\u2019\u2019 (b = .30) and \u2018\u2018Patients cooperation\u2019\u2019 (b= .38) and \"Adherence\"(b = .25) proved to be significant. The construct \u2018\u2018Empathy\u2019\u2019 significantly predicts \u2018\u2018Patient satisfaction\u2019\u2019 (b = .32) and \u2018\u2018Treatment acceptance\u2019\u2019 (b = .17) but does not provide any predictive value for the Patients cooperation and Adherence. In contrast, \u2018\u2018SDM\u2019\u2019 does not provide any direct predictive value for \u2018\u2018Treatment acceptance\u2019\u2019 and only influences the \u2018\u2018Patient satisfaction\u2019\u2019 to a small degree (b = .10), but is a significant predictor of \u2018\u2018Satisfaction with decision\u2019\u2019 (b = .43). \u2018\u2018Satisfaction with decision\u2019\u2019, in turn, has a high predictive value for \u2018\u2018Treatment acceptance\u2019\u2019 (b = .34), but does not provide any predictive value for \u2018\u2018Patient satisfaction\u2019\u2019 (b = .11), \u2018\u2018Patient cooperation\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Adherence\u2019\u2019. \u2018\u2018Adherence\u2019\u2019, however, significantly predicts the \u2018\u2018Patient satisfaction\u2019\u2019 (b = .18) and \u2018\u2018Treatment acceptance\u2019\u2019 (b = .15). Finally, in the framework of this model, for \u2018\u2018Patient cooperation\u2019\u2019, no significan predictive value is shown either for \u2018\u2018Patient satisfaction\u2019\u2019 or for \u2018\u2018Treatment acceptance\u2019\u2019."

    "text": "The most important feature of our model is that the criterion measure, that is, aims and beliefs , is directly affected by all three latent concepts in the model: ELF, ESP and ENL. Contrary to our expectations, in the Hungarian context, ENL seems to have the strongest effect on aims and beliefs. The second most important impact on aims and beliefs is ELF. The third dimension affecting students\u2019 aims and beliefs is ESP with the lowest standardized estimate. In terms of the indirect impact on students\u2019 aims and beliefs, two links proved to be significant: First, ESP shapes aims and beliefs through ENL. Second, ELF exerts an indirect effect on both aims and beliefs as well as ENL through ESP. The absence of a direct link between ELF and ENL is another significant result. Observing the direction of the arrows in the model, we find that while ELF is influencing ESP, ENL is not. Instead the arrow is pointing in the opposite direction, indicating that ESP is shaping students\u2019 views of ENL."

Figure summarizes these and other results. Furthermore, as we predicted, community engagement influences normative pressure positively (\u03b2 = 2.06). Antecedents explain 81% of the variance in community engagement and 31% of the variance in normative community pressure. We found that the impact of normative community pressure on reactance is positive and significant (\u03b2 = .38), as we expected. In addition, 34% of the variance in reactance is explained. As we expected, normative community pressure has significant, negative effects on both community recommendation intentions (\u03b2 = \u2013.13) and community participation intentions (\u03b2 = \u2013.14) , but its effect on membership continuance intentions is not significant. The effects of community engagement on all three behavioral intentions\u2014membership continuance intentions (\u03b2 = 1.12), community recommendation intentions (\u03b2 = .91), and community participation intentions (\u03b2 = .87)\u2014 are significant. Moreover, reactance has a negative impact on membership continuance intentions (\u03b2 = \u2013.26). These results suggest that the negative effects of normative community pressure on membership continuance intentions are fully mediated by reactance. The percentages of variance in membership continuance intentions, community recommendation intentions, and community participation intentions, as explained by their respective antecedents, were 76%, 62%, and 86%, respectively. We predicted a negative impact of reactance on brand loyalty intentions (\u03b2 = \u2013.55). We found that brand relationship quality influences brand community identification significantly. Finally, membership continuance intentions influence brand loyalty intentions significantly (\u03b2 =.26). The antecedents of brand loyalty intentions explain 67% of the variance. Furthermore, we also found support for the other expected relationships, such as a positive impact of brand relationship quality on brand loyalty intentions."

Finally, perceived usefulness (beta = 0.924), and perceived ease of use (beta = 0.732) had sig nificant paths to usability. VR features was only a significant antecedent to presence (beta = 0.871) and perceived enjoyment (beta = 0.835), but was not significantly related to control and active learning in the final model. Usability was a significant antecedent to control and active learning (beta = 0.985), but was not significantly related to presence or perceived enjoyment. VR features did not significantly predict cognitive benefits or reflective thinking, indicating that the representational fidelity and immediacy of control experienced in the VR genetics simulation were not related to student's perceptions of the cognitive benefits or their reflective thinking when using the simulation. As expected, usability was a significant antecedent to cognitive benefits (beta = 0.968), and reflective thinking (beta = 0.952) in this study. Presence was the only psychological variable that was a significant antecedent to motivation effect(beta = 0.429), but it did not directly predict self-efficacy effect or learning. Cognitive benefits was a significant antecedent to self-efficacy effect(beta = 0.329), but it did not directly predict motivation effect or learning. As expected, in this study the motivation effect was significantly related to the self-efficacy effect from prior to after the learning intervention (beta = 0.278). There was not a significant direct relationship between the motivation effect and students\u2019 learning. However, as can be seen in figure, the relationship between motivation effect and learning goes through self-efficacy effect. In this study an increase in self-efficacy effect was significantly related to learning (beta = 0.579)."
