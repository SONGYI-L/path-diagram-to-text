Figure shows the path coefficients for the model and their significance. Regarding the hypothesis tests, all of the hypothesized relationships are supported for the estimated structural model. Total quality management significantly and positively affects both hotel performance (0.446, 8.581) and market orientation (0.388, 7.343). Furthermore, market orientation also significantly and positively affects hotel performance (0.269, 4.906). These results reveal that market orientation mediates the influence on hotel performance."

These factors explained 42% of the variation of self-efficacy. However, the direct effect of the knowledge application was much less than the direct effect of the two dimensions of learning experiences. Students\u2019 motivation had a positive direct effect on cognitive learning outcome. Knowledge application is positively predicted by their ratings on intrinsic value (\u03b2 = 0.25) and self efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.18) in completing the service learning subject.

A surprising result was that the direct path between perceived usefulness and intention to use was insignificant, as was the perceived ease of use effect on intention to use. Instead, the effect of context on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use was found significant, with path coefficients of 0.56 and 0.77. As expected, perceived ease of use had a direct effect on perceived usefulness. Finally, no direct positive effect was found between personal initiative and character and intention to use."

In terms of individual effects, attidaw have the strongest impact on awocons. Similar to attidaw and class, price has also a sizeable impact on awcons in the model. The lowest impact on awcons is that of children in the household, while access to info and reason have slightly higher effects. Attidaw significantly impact awcons in a positive relationship. Class has a significant positive impact on awcons in the model. We found a negative relationship between reason and awcons. Unexpectedly, children has a negative impact on the variable \u201cinfo\u201d. On the other hand, price significantly impacts awcons in a negative relationship."

To restate, the entertainment, interaction, and word-of-mouth effects of Social media marketing activities work positively in enhancing customer equity drivers. Value equity and relationship equity had no significant effect on customer equity, while brand equity had a negative influence (\u03b2=\u2212.45). The estimation results show that value equity (\u03b2= .47) and brand equity (\u03b2= .66) had positive effects on purchase intention. However, relationship equity did not have a significant influence on purchase intention. Purchase intention likely will improve by Social media marketing activities through value equity and brand equity. Finally, a path between purchase intention and customer equity was significant (\u03b2= .83). Since a path from purchase intention to customer equity is significant, Social media marketing activities of luxury fashion brands could consequently influence customer equity through the effects of value equity and brand equity on purchase intention."

School values in bureaucratic linkage and cultural linkage are themselves correlated with a coefficient of 0.39. It is evident that teachers\u2019 feelings about school life regress negatively on bureaucratic linkage and positively on cultural linkage. It seems that cultural linkage has positive effects on teachers\u2019 commitment, job satisfaction, sense of community, and order and discipline, whereas bureaucratic linkage has negative effects on all these aspects. Among others, job satisfaction is more vulnerable to the effects of school values in both bureaucratic linkage and cultural linkage."

Regarding the interrelationships among endogenous variables, the results indicated that attitudes toward sustainability had a positive direct effect (\u03b2=0.67) on behaviors pertaining to sustainability. Similarly, participants\u2019 tendency to engage in outdoor activities had a positive direct effect on behaviors (\u03b2=0.28). Furthermore, the results reflected positive direct effect of environmental values on behaviors pertaining to sustainability (\u03b2=0.15). It was also found that the effect of attitudes on participants\u2019 tendency to engage in out door activities was statistically significant (\u03b2= 0.77). The significant effect of outdoor activities on environmental values (\u03b2= 0.18) showed that this endogenous variable could act as a mediator between attitudes and values. The latent exogenous variable of gender had a significant direct ef fect on attitudes toward sustainability. Furthermore, it was seen that the effect of gender on participants\u2019 outdoor activities was significant(\u0393=0.79)."

Thermal sensation was operationalized by microclimatic conditions including perceived temperature (r = 0.561), perceived solar radiation level (r = 0.198), perceived wind speed (r = - 0.588) and perceived humidity level (r = 0.388), also by personal characteristics including age (r = 0.210), metabolic rate (r = 0.144) clothing value (r = 0.549), purpose of visit (r = 0.133) and thermal sensitivity (r = 0.187). In summer, people would feel less comfortable if they perceived strong solar radiation, high air temperature, low wind speed or high humidity (r = -0.344). In addition, thermal sensation of individuals was affected by their purpose of visit. People visiting a park for leisure purpose were more inclined to feel comfortable than those who came for work. Thermal comfort perceived by park visitors was found to be enhanced if they preceived a large amount of trees, water ponds or shade provisions to be present in parks (r = 0.142, 0.084 and 0.060). An individual\u2019s thermal acceptability was shown to be influenced by the thermal comfort perceived (r = 0.637) and thermal sensation (r = -0.218). In addition, thermal acceptability could also be improved by having more trees, water ponds or shade provisions immediately visible in summer (r = 0.115, 0.088 and 0.042). Immediate visibility of trees were found to have a stronger impact than water ponds and in turn much stronger than shade provisions."

While the relatively strong effects of INT and HAB strength were expected, the standardized regression weight of PBC on BEH is unexpectedly low, even if it was anticipated that the majority of the impact of PBC would be mediated by INT and PN. 36% of variation in behaviour was explained by the three variables, which is relatively low compared to models tested on a specific behaviour. INT are the first integrative variable, being influenced by ATT, PBC, PN and SN (in descending order of the magnitude of their impact). These four variables explain 55% of variation in intentions. Both the amount of explained variation and the strength of the impact of the variables fulfilled the expectations. The second integrative variable is PN, which is significantly predicted by SN, PBC, AC, AR, ST, SE (negative relation), and the NEP (in descending order of the magnitude of their impact). Together these seven variables explain 47% of variation in PN. There is not much variation in the impact the seven variables have on personal norms. AR should be more closely related to PN than for example general value orientations. HAB strength is related to INT, PN, and PBC as expected. The three variables explain 26% of variation in habit strength. The NEP is predicted positively by ST and negatively by SE. However, the strict causal chain leading from NEP via AC and AR to PN could not be confirmed."

    "text": "The latent variable, tax and social security payments, is constructed with seven indicators, which are based on official tax data and indicators concerning the impact of taxes. The highest loadings (correlations) are estimated for the broader indicators total tax revenue (0.95) as share of GDP and Tax and social security revenue (0.90) as share of GDP, whereas more specific indicators, such as total tax rate of profit (0.10), have less influence. Higher tax and social security payments increase the shadow economy (0.13) in the multivariate model. The latent variable, tax complexity and surveillance, is constructed with six indicators, which are based on specific cost of tax procedures and tax inspections. The highest loadings (correlations) are estimated for the indicators costs of compliance for importing and exporting (0.89) and number of tax payments per person (0.82), and for weaker indicators, such as tax staff per tax payers (0.42). The complexity and surveillance cannot be entirely separated because the complexity is often a result of enhanced surveillance. More tax complexity and surveillance reduces the shadow economy (\u22120.18). An explanation can be that complex tax systems offer more options to avoid paying taxes legally and hence reduce illegal activities per definition. The latent variable tax moral is constructed with two indicators bribe acceptable survey (0.95) and government benefits claimable survey (0.94). The tax moral shows no significant influence on the shadow economy (-0.01), but results should be regarded with care due to measuring problems. The R2 for the partial model Tax System is 0.73."

In contrast to the direction hypothesized, though significant, normative pressure has a negative significant relationship with intention to use SNS (\u03b2 = -.08).

There was a relationship between CM and BP in the context of retail firms doing business in the supermarket industry of Santa Catarina. This hypothesis was also confirmed, corroborating the results of earlier studies that had demonstrated a positive relationship between CM and BP. It is also noteworthy that the relationship was confirmed by a positive standardized factor loading of 0.72. This result enabled another of the objectives to be achieved: identification of a relationship between CM and BP. There was a relationship between EO and BP. It can be concluded that this hypothesis was also confirmed, corroborating the results of a considerable proportion of previous studies of EO and BP, as the relationship was shown to be positive. This hypothesis was confirmed with a standardized factor loading of 0.513, achieving another part of the objective, which was to identify a relationship between EO and CM."

Standard regression weights are 0.59 (significant at the 0.001 level) between technological strategy and partner intensity constructs and 0.47 (significant at the 0.001 level) between partner intensity and innovation performance. In the case of phases intensity their measures are 0.41 (significant at the 0.001 level) and 0.19 (significant at the 0.01 level), respectively. Concerning the construct openness variety, instead, its central role on the final impact on innovation performance is evident. Regression weight is 0.27 (significant at the 0.01 level). The negative impact is, in turn, influenced by the constructs partner intensity and phase intensity. The first positively impacts on openness variety: measured regression weight is 0.40 (significant at the 0.001 level). The second pattern, on the contrary, reveals a negative impact: regression weight is 0.29 (significant at the 0.001 level)."

The model generated also suggests that the Aact is strongly influenced by SN. This implies that for SN have only a slight direct influence on the BI, but that they determine it indirectly by influencing Aact. \"IN\" influences \"EK\" positively, and the \"IS\" construct determines \"ATA\". \"EK\" again effects the \"Aact\" positively. The magnitude of this relationship is, however, very low. The hypothesis can thus be claimed as being confirmed, but the deduction of any further implications is not really possible. This is also true for the relationship between the constructs \"ATA\" and \"Aact\". Additionally, the positive relationship between \"PU\" and \"Aact\" is confirmed as well as the positive influence of PUinf, PUent, and PUsoc on overall utility. Confirmation can also be found for the negative influence of \"PR\" on the Aact."

Lower education resulted in follow-up unemployment both directly as well as indirectly via its relationships with pre-injury unemployment and with behavioural changes. Similarly, longer PTA duration affected employment outcome both directly as well as indirectly, by its association with behavioural and cognitive changes. Spinal injuries were related to employment outcome indirectly through its association with mood changes. Limb injuries affected employment outcome directly."

The four latent variables all exhibited negative direct effects on the soil burdens of SVBPs, and the effect coefficients increased in magnitude in the order of 0.048 (soil characteristics) < 0.083 (climate conditions) < 0.126 (topographic conditions) < 0.572 (compounds properties). In addition, topographic conditions posed impacts on the climate conditions and soil characteristics, which led to the two indirect effect pathways. Despite the large chemical diversities of compounds, the pesticides with low VP and high LogKOW values were found to readily accumulate in soils. Moreover, compounds properties displayed the negative direct effect (\u22120.572) on the soil burdens of SVBPs. Namely, the compounds with high VP and low LogKOW are usually poorly concentrated in soils. The topographic conditions indicated by elevation and slope, posed notable negative effects on the soil burdens of SVBPs, relative to climate conditions and soil characteristics. The two climate factors, MAP and MAT, had effect on the soil burdens of SVBPs. The sand and SOC, two representatives of soil characteristics, had effect on the soil burdens of SVBPs, as the two soil characteristics were negatively correlated. The soil burdens of SVBPs are dependent on soil characteristics, topographic conditions of soil , compounds properties and/or their interaction effects. By comparison, soil characteristics (including SOC) pose minor influences on the soil burdens of SVBPs, compared to both topographic and climate conditions of soil sites."

However, perceived behavioral control has the highest impact followed by attitude and subjective norm. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were found to significantly relate to attitude with 0.486 and 0.491, respectively. Concerning normative beliefs, instructor readiness significantly influenced subjective norm (b = 0.579), but student readiness did not influence subjective norm. Finally, for control beliefs, both perceived self-efficacy and learning autonomy were significantly related to perceived behavior control with 0.639 and 0.243, respectively."

The latent variable labor market regulations depends mainly on the three indicators costs of workers dismissal (0.71), a labor freedom index (0.61) by Heritage Foundation and centralized collective bargaining (\u22120.54). All indicators are scaled so that higher numbers mean more freedom and less regulation. The fourth indicator hiring and firing practices (\u22120.01) is nearly uncorrelated with the labor market regulations and has no connection to the shadow economy. Higher costs of worker dismissal lead to more shadow economy, while more centralized collective bargaining leads to less shadow economy. These two indicators are nearly uncorrelated (0.09), demonstrating that the concept of labor market regulations is not one-dimensional. Using more than one indicator is absolutely necessary at this point to avoid misleading conclusion. The remaining latent variables unemployment (0.00), participation rights (\u22120.06) and labor wages (0.03) have no significant influence on the shadow economy ceteris paribus."

In turn marital functioning mediated the relationship between sexual satisfaction and family functioning. Sexual satisfaction was also found to be influenced by anxiety through the mediation of BISCS during intimacy. Of the demographic variables, only gender was maintained in the final model due to its direct influence on both sexual problems and sexual satisfaction."

Increasing man justified IPVAW in the community was positively associated only spousal physical abuse (b= 1.385), but not sexual abuse and emotional abuse. Similarly, increasing women who had witnessed IPVAW in the community was positively associated only spousal physical abuse (b= 0.703), but not sexual and emotional abuse. There was positive correlation between all three types of IPVAW at community-level (physical vs. emotional [b = 0.485]; physical vs. sexual [b = 0.659]; and sexual vs. emotional [b = 0.579]). In addition, there was positive correlation between woman and man justified IPVAW at community level (b = 0.010), such that women with tolerant attitudes were more likely to have husbands with tolerant attitudes too. However, community-level correlations between woman and man justified IPVAW were relatively less pronounced."

In turn, urgency and lack of perseverance, which correlated with each other independently of impulsivity (r = 0.20, P < 0.001), predicted sleep problems (R2 = 0.14). Thus, the use of aggressive suppression and worry to counter unwanted intrusive thoughts at bedtime mediated the effects of urgency and lack of perseverance on sleep problems. The effects of urgency and lack of perseverance on insomnia were almost completely mediated by the use of aggressive suppression and worry."

Conversely, caregivers with more years of education, lower social resources, and higher work stress were more likely to demonstrate psychological abuse behavior."

Accordingly, TMC emerges as the most CSF with a path coefficient of 0.853. The success factors have a significant positive impact on the success of the construction organization, is found to be supported because the path coefficient (0.99) is significant at a 0.05 significance level. The TMC is the most CSF with a path coefficient of 0.853. This factor consists of the following attributes: (1) an effective risk management capability in the organization (TMC1), (2) professionalism/culture in the organization (TMC2), (3) competitive strategy used by the organization (TMC3), and (4) financial soundness of the organization in terms of better liquidity and working capital (TMC4). Because these attributes are directly governed by the top management, the name is top management competence. The EP is the second most important success factor with a path coefficient of 0.78. The attributes under this factor are (1) client\u2019s satisfaction in terms of product and services (EP1) and (2) customer satisfaction in terms of product and services (EP2), (3) the company\u2019s reputation/track record (EP3), and (4) experience in the construction business (EP4). EP is highly significant for the success of organizations. The CCM received a path coefficient of 0.71 and was placed at the third position. The attributes under this factor are (1) availability of cost control measures in the organization (CCM1) and (2) favorable government policies (CCM2). The lowest possible overall cost in the organization can be achieved only when the cost control measures taken by the organization are effectively keeping in view the objectives of the owner\u2019s investment. The RES was placed at the fourth position with a path coefficient of 0.68. The attributes under this factor are (1) the availability of qualified staff in the organization (RES1) and (2) the availability of equipment, material, and labor as per requirement of the project (RES2). Availability of qualified staff in the organization is the key to its success in a competitive market. The SCL was placed at the last position with a very low path coefficient of 0.51. The attributes under this factor are (1) efficient supply chain management (SCL1) and (2) availability of dynamic leadership (SCL2). Supply chain management has a strong correlation with project success."

Within the sample, trust in benevolence had a statistically signifcant association with all student engagement sub-dimensions, that is, vigor, dedication, and absorption. Trust in honesty also had a statistically signifcant association with student engagement\u2019s absorption and vigor, but not with dedication. Afective commitment had a statistically signifcant efect on all student engagement dimensions, that is, vigor, dedication, and absorption. Afective confict did not have a statistically signifcant association with any student engagement dimensions. Last, satisfaction had a statistically signifcant association with student engagement\u2019s dimension of vigor. However, no statistically signifcant association was found with student engagement\u2019s dimensions of absorption and dedication. Further examination of the structural model indicated that absorption and vigor did not have a statistically signifcant association with alumni loyalty, in contrast to dedication, which did have a statistically signifcant association with alumni loyalty. Figure shows the path model diagram including statistically signifcant path loadings and signifcance levels."

This model is considered proficient particularly in the estimation of Patronage Loyalty, where Brand Trust and Brand Affect explained the former almost entirely. All associations amongst the latent constructs in the overall structural model were significant except for the association between Perception of Mall and Brand Trust. Although insignificant, there was evidence to suggest that Perception of Mall can improve Patronage Loyalty via the indirect effect of Brand Trust. This indirect effect was also imminently enhanced with the significant semi-partial correlation between Brand Trust and Brand Affect. The rest of the associations were positive and the strength of these associations was considerable. The results also confirmed that Brand Trust and Brand Affect were correlated (0.62). Therefore, there was a semi-partial effect of these two constructs on Patronage Loyalty. In short, both constructs, i.e. Brand Trust and Brand Affect, had internal consistency."

Edu was also significantly associated with DSY. The greatest contribution to PI came from Mn-A. NBT was negatively associated with age, PI, Mn-B, and Mn-A, in decreasing order."

Of the four paths that were examined in the structural models, only three were statistically significant \u2013 the exception being perceived usefulness. In contrast, the other three paths leading to usage were all ignificant: subjective norm, perceived enjoyment, and perceived ease of use.

    "text": "The SEM-analyzed data provide evidence that the three dimensions of an entrepreneur\u2019s resilience (hardiness, optimism, and resourcefulness) have direct and positive impacts on creative performance, but with different effect sizes. Resilience resourcefulness was found to have the highest impact size (0.26) on creative performance, followed by resilience optimism (0.24) and resilience hardiness (0.23). More specifically, the path from resilience hardiness to institutional orientation (0.46) and the path from institutional orientation to creative performance (0.56) were found to be significant with positive signs, thus supporting the effect of institutional orientation in the relationship between resilience hardiness and creative performance. Similarly, the impact of resilience resourcefulness on institutional orientation (0.41) and the impact of institutional orientation on creative performance (0.56) were found to be significant with positive signs, thus supporting institutional orientation in the relationship between resilience resourcefulness and creative performance. Finally, the effect of resilience optimism on institutional orientation (0.44) and the effect of institutional orientation on creative performance (0.56) were found to be significant and positive, thus supporting the effect of institutional orientation in the relationship between resilience optimism and creative performance."

Functional value induces positive customer satisfaction. From the results of hypothesis testing, several paths of this model were supported: feel perception affects customer satisfaction by means of emotional value; service quality affects customer satisfaction by means of functional and emotional values; and think perception affects customer satisfaction through emotional and functional values. The results also showed that think perception and service quality have stronger effects than sense perception and feel perception because of the larger coefficients of think perception and service quality in the model. In addition, the results demonstrated that think perception and service quality are very important factors when a company attempts to implement experiential marketing."

    "text": "This study explains the fundamental argument that internet banking adoption intentions are highly influenced by respondents\u2019 attitude toward internet banking, and these attitudes are influenced by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. The latter two are the fundamental TAM constructs of internet banking services which are further affected by social influence, internet banking awareness, quality of internet connections and computer self-efficacy. The quality of internet connection is still a major issue in many developing countries like India. As a result of this study, social influence emerged as a major determinant ( 0.50) of the attitude toward online banking. The value 0.50 reflects that friends and relatives play a significant role in motivating customers to use online banking. It is also observed that respondents rarely receive information about online banking from banks, and therefore, the coefficient of internet banking awareness is low (0.32). Thus, low internet banking awareness is an important factor that may result in a lower rate of internet banking adoption. The effect of demographic details on attitude toward online banking is not statistically significant. The value of R2 for perceived ease of use is 0.376. That is, 37.6 per cent of variance is explained by the two factors quality of internet connection and computer self-efficacy."

In other words, worker perceptions of the creative environment will be significantly related to turnover intentions. Stated in terms of the research model, workers who have creativity support, creativity work characteristics, and a low to zero presence of creativity blocks, will be more likely to stay and less likely to leave. Furthermore, model evaluation strongly suggests that these findings are relevant for non-creative professional employees."

Figure 4 also shows the remaining nine variables that reflected their intended SPO constructs in the structural equation model. These were three structure-related dimensions: availability of equipment (S1), supply of critical medicines (S2) and accessibility of chronic disease care (S4); three process-related dimensions: attending to patients\u2019 health needs (P2), professional conduct of the nurses (P3) and friendliness of the nurses (P4); and three outcome-related dimensions: coherence of integrated chronic disease care (O1), patient confidence in the nurses (O3), and competence of the nurses (O5). Findings from the mediation path model showed that three structure-related dimensions of care (availability of equipment; supply of critical medicines; and accessibility of chronic disease care) correlated directly with three outcome-related dimensions of care (coherence of integrated chronic disease care; and competence of the nurses and patient confidence in the nurses) and three process-related dimensions of care (nurses\u2019 friendliness with patients; professional conduct of the nurses; and attendance of the nurses to patients\u2019 health needs). Independent of structure, good process correlated with good outcome, an indication that good process mediated the relationship between good structure and good outcome."

Finally, RDT exerts a significant positive influence on EC. Finally, taking into account the weights showed by the two dimensions of EC, i.e. S (0.255) and M (0.889), it can be observed that motivation is more important than skills in the make-up of EC."
