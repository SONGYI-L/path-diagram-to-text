The employees' skills have a positive influence on business performance. Results also show that n.p.flexibility, v.flexibility or mix flexibility, either do are significantly related to business performance. Our research suggests that manufacturing flexibility does have a positive significant direct effect on business performance."

On the other hand, the positive influence of trust in e-government on e-government use was confirmed with t-value of 2.940. The results of the assessment of the mediating effect of trust in e-government on the relationship between the digital divide and e-government systems success indicate that the access divide does not have a mediation effect. The influence of the access divide on trust in e-government is not significant (t-value = 0.463). In other words, we can conclude that the trust in e-government does not have a mediation role."

Good cultural fit had the strongest influence (0.724), followed by dedicated team (0.701), flexible response to change (0.692), company wide acceptance (0.681), and long-term perspective (0.470), while formation at design stage was the least influential (0.397). The SEM framework measures the latent variable of long-term quality perspective according to commitment to quality, commitment to continuous improvement, questioning attitude, long-term perspective and formation at the design stage. Commitment to continuous improvement was found to have the greatest influence on long-term quality perspective (0.918) followed by commitment to quality (0.785), questioning attitudes (0.321), and long-term perspective (0.279), while formation at the design stage had the least influence (0.229), most likely due to the increased versatility and complexity of the construction industry and the evolution of required skills and procedures. The SEM framework measures the latent variable for consistent objectives by referring to clear understanding, acting consistently with objectives, technical expertise and questioning attitudes, with clear understanding exhibiting the greatest effect on consistent objectives (0.679), followed by acting consistently with objec tives (0.639) and technical expertise (0.627), while questioning attitudes exhibited the least influence (0.319). The SEM framework measures the resource sharing latent variable by reference to financial security, availability of resources, equal power/empowerment and questioning attitudes. Availability of resources had the strongest effect on resource sharing (0.713), followed by equal power/empowerment (0.683) and financial security (0.590), while questioning attitudes had the smallest effect (0.161)."

Heavier mothers also allowed their children less control over their food intake. Mothers with a higher status gave their children more control and used pressure in feeding more often. Furthermore, there were age related influences. The rewarding strategy was related to a higher consumption of unhealthy food. Mother's use of modeling was coupled with a strong increase of healthy and a moderate decrease of unhealthy food. In addition, we assumed direct effects of the covariates on the child's food intake too. Whereas the maternal weight status did not show a significant influence, the socioeconomic status and the child's age did. Hence, children with a higher socioeconomic status seemed to consume more healthy food and less unhealthy food. Regarding the influences of child's age, mothers of younger children reported a higher consumption of healthy food and a less frequent consumption of unhealthy food."

The second significant factor influencing labor productivity performance is workforce, with a \u03b2 value of 0.84. Although the finance dimension is insignificantly correlated with labor productivity, the influence of the external dimension has been revealed in the model as statistically significant (\u03b2 = 0.79).

Based on the results of the path analysis, the A.T and E.T.N were those variables that had significantly positive correlations with M.T only through one path, which was direct, and A.T had the highest positive direct correlation among them. The next variable was the E.T.P, which had a significant, direct, and negative correlation with M.T (B = \u22120.29). Moreover, F,T through the mediating concerns of E.T.P also had a significant positive relationship with M.T through the indirect path. The results of the model fit indices showed the favorableness and high fit of the model as well as the rationality of the regulated relationships between the variables based on the conceptual model. Accordingly, it was shown that F.T has a direct effect on the A.T in the primary model."

The first variables in the list most strongly explain intention to act and thus provide the strongest key to under standing but also influencing action in favor of the technology. Fig. 3 shows the causal paths that represent significant causal effects. The following assumed relationships between variables in the model were not found to be statistically significant (and thus also not depicted in Fig. 3): - Negative affect on attitude towards acting. - Environmental problem perception, energy security problem perception, negative affect and distributive fairness on personal norm. - Environmental problem perception, distributive fairness and trust in industry on positive affect.- Environmental problem perception, energy security problem perception and trust in the municipality on negative affect. - Environmental problem perception on perceived effects. The final model also diverges from the conceptual model because two paths are added, being - perceived effects on subjective norm. - positive affect on intention to act."

    "text": "All ten hypotheses achieved significant results statistically. The paths demonstrate positive relationships between the constructs, meaning that when a specified construct moves positively or negatively, another specified construct will move positively and negatively correspondingly. The standardised coefficients of the ten paths range from 0.17 to 0.65. The three most significant paths are international strat brand performance; control of marketing activities determining comm; and comm determining strat; with standardised coefficients of 0.65, 0.56 and 0.52, respectively. These results firstly indicate the importance of strat, which can enhance a firm\u2019s brand performance by 0.65 standardised points for every standardised point increase in strat. Secondly, control of marketing activities is an important determinant of international commitment such that an increase of one standardised point of extent of control of marketing activities will lead to 0.56 standardised points of international commitment. Finally, international commitment is a critical input to international marketing strategy. Every single standardised point of increase in international commitment can lead to an increase of international marketing strategy by 0.52 standardised points."

    "text": "This model confirmed that Processes has a significant direct relationship with Goals (with path coefficient =0.90), and it explains and influences 82 percent of the variance in Goals. As previously mentioned, the value of SEM lies in its ability to depict both the direct and indirect effects between the variables. In light of this, the best-fit model appears to indicate that People strongly influences Partnerships and resources, whereas Partnerships and resources moderately influences Policy and Strategy. Both People and Policy and strategy, were found to have significant direct relationships with Processes (with path coefficient =0.46 and 0.62, respectively). No statistically significant relationship, however, was found between Partnerships and resources, and Processes, indicating the absence of a direct effect. An indirect effect, though, exists through Policy and strategy. Partnerships and resources was found to have a positive impact on Policy and strategy (path coefficient =0.36) which, in turn, influences Processes. It is worth noting that R2 for Processes was 0.99, demonstrating that 99 per cent of the variance associated with Processes was accounted for by its two predictors, namely People and Policy and strategy. Leadership shows significant direct relationship with People (path coefficient =0.64) and Policy and strategy (path coefficient =0.59), but surprisingly bears no statistically significant relationship with Partnerships and resources. The relatively strong influence People had on Partnerships and resources (path coefficient =0.86) suggests that Leadership indirectly influences Partnerships and resources through People."

Innovation appears to be also influenced strongly by transformational leadership (0.37). Our research shows that innovation is strongly affected by transformational leadership and organiza tional learning. The results also show that transformational leadership is highly related to and affects organizational learning (0.81). Thus, one of the essential characteristics that firms must consider in analyzing organizational learning is transformational lead ership. A transformational leadership style improves the development of learning within an organization. Furthermore, we observe an indirect effect of transformational leadership on innovation through organizational learning. Finally, the parameter estimates verify a positive and statistically significant association between organizational learning and performance, both directly (0.24) and indirectly, via innovation. The positive, significant relationship between innovation and performance (0.73). Of these two variables (organizational learning and innovation), innovation shows the greatest influence on organizational performance. In addition to these effects, we observe an indirect effect of transformational leadership on performance via organizational learning, innovation, and organizational learning."

Brand association had a direct effect on student satisfaction (0.38), student trust (0.69), and student commitment (0.94). Student trust had a direct effect on student satisfaction (0.17), and student commitment also had a direct effect on student satisfaction, as shown by the path coefficient of 0.45. The total effect of brand association on student satisfaction was 0.92 (0.38+0.69*0.17+0.94*0.45).

The p-test design scale has four subscales: perceived test demand for linguistic knowledge, perceived test demand for reading skills, perceived test demand for listening skills, and perceived test demand for writing skills. In this measurement model, the latent factor of p-test design represents the degree of test takers\u2019 positive endorsement of test design. The higher the endorsement of liguistic knowledge as necessary for test taking, the more the test takers perceived test design as positive. Endorsement of test demand is also indicative of test takers\u2019 knowledge of the test. The test preparation scale includes five sub-scales representing five types of test preparation practices: using socio-affective strategies to seek external help and to motivate oneself, conducting test analysis via assessing test requirements and evaluating oneself, memorizing vocabulary and model essays, drilling target language skills, and rehearsing test-taking skills. The latent factor of Test Prep represents the degree of engagement in preparation indicated by coherent uses of various strategies."

With an increasing number of family members, the probability of on-street parking increases (with the direct effect of 0.035), and the walking distance decreases (with the direct effect of \u22120.026). More travelers choose on-street parking with an increasing number of passengers. As for the parking period, the results indicate that work trips are more likely to involve peak-period parking (with the direct effect of 0.046), while maintenance trips are more likely to choose parking during an off-peak period (with the direct effect of maintenance trips on parking in the peak period being \u22120.039). In addition, the influences of exogenous variables on walking distance contrast with those of on-street parking. For example, the probability of on-street parking increases with the increasing number of family members or passengers, while the walking distance decreases. There is only one exogenous variable, i.e., payment mode, which has an impact on the parking rate."

However, it does have a significant indirect effect on both behavioral intention to use and actual use through perceived usefulness, and also has a significantly positive direct effect on perceived usefulness (0.33). The data also shows that perceived usefulness significantly directly influences the behavioral intention to use (0.33) and indirectly influences actual use. The result confirms that compatibility positively and directly influences both perceived usefulness (0.46) and behavioral intention to use (0.51). This implies that compatibility has indirect effects on both behavioral intention to use through perceived usefulness, and actual use through behavioral intention to use. The cost has a significant negative effect on the behavioral intention to use (-0.11); yet, except perceived ease of use, it is less effective compared to other constructs. Although the perceived risk has a significant effect on behavioral intention to use (0.14); moreover, it also has a positive indirect effect on actual use."

The findings suggest that a restaurant firm should carefully design the physical environment to improve the customer\u2019s perceived reasonableness of the price. D\u00e9cor and artifacts had a significant positive effect on customer satisfaction (.33, 4.06). However, spatial layout and ambient conditions had no significant direct effects on customer satisfaction (.12, 1.78; .06, 1.03). These results showed the significant mediating role of price percep tion in the relationships between spatial layout/ambient conditions and customer satisfaction. Moreover, the results also show that price perception had a positive effect on customer satisfaction (.56, 5.11). This finding indicated that customer satisfaction level increases when price is considered reasonable. Finally, the direct effect of price perception and customer satisfaction on customer loyalty was statistically significant (.24, 2.08; .56, 5.06). This result was consistent with previous findings that price perception and satisfaction are significant predictors of customer loyalty."

They are easily identified as each one of them has a single-headed arrow pointing at them. They are FB1.1, FB1.2, FB1.3 and FB1.4. The independent factor (unobserved exogenous) is FB2.0 and it exerts a direct influence on the four dependent factors with the pathways postulated all being statistically and substantially significant. In addition FB1.2 had an indirect but significant effect on FB1.3 as was postulated. FB1.2 also had an indirect yet significant influence on FB1.4. The squared multiple correlation (SMC) of FB1.3 was 0.930 indicating that its two predictors, namely, FB2.0 and FB1.2, explain 93.0% of the variance present in FB1.3. This indicates the importance of both of these predictors in facilitating learning among students. One can conclude that the six causal paths postulated were all found to be statistically significant and substantively meaningful. These pathways indicate the impact of instructional leadership on ensuring that FB1.1, FB1.2, FB1.3 and FB1.4. FB1.3 is also facilitated by FB1.2. These four subdimensions are thus potent determinants of teachers\u2019 perceptions of FB2.0."

There is therefore, a causal link between QM practices and organizational performance. The SEM helps to establish such a causal link. The data also showed that QM practices are significantly correlated with the supplier selection strategy. Supplier participation and supplier selection are also found to be correlated. In the case of the data, the correlation coefficient is high at 0.682. Further, the result does not show that supplier selection strategy influences organizational performance. Our sample data did not support the hypothesis that QM practices have any direct impact on organizational performance."

    "text": "Figure shows the standardized path coefficients and the overall fit indexes. Since the goodness-of-fit measures are within the range of recommended levels, the model should be acceptable. Most hypotheses are also validated. While cost-saving, convenience, selection, and information availability has positive influence on utilitarian motivation, lack of sociality, and customized product and service has no causal relationships with utilitarian motivation. On the other hand, while adventure/explore, and authority and status have positive influence on hedonic motivation, social, idea, and value have no causal relationships with hedonic motivation. Utilitarian and hedonic motivations have significant impact on search intention. Utilitarian motivation and search intention have significant impact on purchase intention. The study shows that factors influencing utilitarian motivation are led by convenience, followed by cost saving, information availability and selection (judging by the level of standardized path coefficient). The factors influencing hedonic motivation are adventure/explore, authority and status accordingly. Both utilitarian motivation and hedonic motivation would influence search intention, of which utilitarian motivation was more influential. Utilitarian motivation would directly or indirectly influence purchase intention via search intention while hedonic motivation could only indirectly influence purchase intention via search intention. In summary, utilitarian motivation is more important than hedonic motivation in terms of influencing search or purchase intention. This study tries to determine whether a direct relationship exists between hedonic motivation and purchase intention. No significant relationship has been found. This study also tries to discover whether any hidden relationships exist between different kinds of values and shopping motivations. The result did not find any utilitarian values that would influence hedonic motivation and vice versa."

    "text": "Figure reports all standardized path coefficients and presents the relationships among constructs in the model. Specifically, role stress has an indirect effect on turnover intention through burnout. Role stress was strongly associated with burnout (\u03b2 = 0.70), but not directly with turnover intention. Burnout was significantly associated with turnover intention among social workers (\u03b2 = 0.41). This suggests that burnout mediates the relationship between role stress and turnover intention. Regarding the effects of social support and job autonomy, the results only partially support that social support and job autonomy are negatively associated with burnout and turnover intention. Social support (\u03b2 = \u22120.19) and job autonomy (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.19) were negatively associated with turnover intention, while job autonomy and social support were not associated with burnout. The interaction term between job autonomy and role stress was negatively significant in explaining burnout, which suggests that the relationship between role stress and burnout is stronger when job autonomy is lower. Furthermore, an interaction term between social support and role stress was negatively associated with turnover intention, which suggests that the relationship between role stress and turnover intention is stronger when social support is lower. Regarding demographic variables in the model, age was significantly associated with burnout (\u03b2 = \u22120.11). In addition, organizational tenure (\u03b2 = 0.20) and annual salary (\u03b2 = \u22120.14) were associated with turnover intention, indicating that workers with longer organizational tenure and lower annual salary have greater intention to quit."

As we proposed and expected, the path coefficients of both RISK \u2192 INTENTION and BENEFIT \u2192 INTENTION were significant. The hypothesized path from CDT, a personality-oriented trust antecedent, had a positive significant effect on TRUST. Among the hypothesized paths from the perception based and affect-based trust antecedents to RISK, PPP, PSP, TPS, and REP had significant negative effects on risk. The hypothesized path from IQ to RISK was not significant. Interestingly, FAM had positive effects on a consumer's trust and purchasing intention, but the effect of familiarity on a consumer's perceived risk was not significant. The logistic regression model also included three other constructs (RISK, BENEFIT and TRUST) as potential predictors so that the effects of INTENTION on PURCHASE could be isolated from other effects. We found that intention was indeed a strong predictor of purchase (beta=.397, R2=.301) while other constructs did not have a strong effect on purchase. In sum, the results strongly suggest that when consumers have a higher level of intention to purchase from an Internet vendor's Website, they are more likely to actually purchase from that site."

    "text": "As shown in figure, the main model estimations revealed that 8 out of 11 hypotheses were significant while 3 were not significant. The following eight hypotheses were positively significant; hence, they were supported. Perceived usefulness will have a significant positive effect on the behavioural intention. As shown in the figure, the standardized regression weight and critical ratio for perceived usefulness to behavioural intention is 0.397 and .367 respectively, suggesting that this path is statistically significant. In summary, these results further suggest that perceived usefulness was a major determinant of behavioural intentions. Perceived ease of use will have a significant positive effect on the behavioural intention. As presented in figure, the standardized regression weight and critical ratio for perceived ease of use to behavioural intention was 0.288 and 6.075 respectively, indicating statistical significance. The results suggested that the perceived ease of use has positive strong effect on the behavioural intention towards online banking information system acceptance and use. In summary, along with perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use was found to be an important determinant of user acceptance of the online banking system; however, it was found to be relatively less influential than the perceived usefulness. Trust will have a significant positive effect on the behavioural intention. Figure revealed that the standardized regression weight for the trust to the behavioural intention was 0.279 and the critical ratio for the trust to the behavioural intention value was 4.874. These results indicated that trust has strong significant effect on behavioural intention to use an online banking information system. Lastly, these results further suggested that trust was as important determinant of behavioural intentions to use, as were the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Trust will have a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness. The standardized regression weight for the trust to the perceived usefulness was 0.453 and critical ratio for the trust to the perceived usefulness value was 7.306. In summary, trust was found to be an important factor, which positively influences behavioural intentions, both directly and indirectly through perceived usefulness, towards online banking information systems\u2019 acceptance and use. Technological self-efficacy will have a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness. Figure revealed that the standardized regression weight and critical ratio estimate for the technological self-efficacy to the perceived usefulness were 0.194 and 3.026, respectively. In brief, technological self-efficacy was found as a significant determinant of the perceived usefulness of online banking system. Technological self-efficacy will have a significant positive effect on perceived ease of use. As shown in figure, the standardized regression weight and critical ratio estimate for the techonology self-efficacy to the perceived ease of use were 0.373 and 6.43, respectively. In short, technological self-efficacy was found as a significant determinant of perceived ease of use. Perceived accessibility will have a significant positive effect on perceived ease of use. Figure showed that the standardised regression weight and critical ratio estimate for the accessibility to the perceived ease of use were 0.243 and 4.126, respectively. In summary, accessibility was found to be the major determinant of the perceived ease of use, suggesting the users perceptions of ease of use were strongly influenced by the accessibility. Terminology clarity will have a positive significant effect on perceived usefulness. Results of the standardised regression weight and critical ratio estimate for the terminology clarity to perceived ease of use were 0.139 and 2.848, respectively. In summary, terminology clarity was found to be strong determinant of perceived ease of use. However, the terminology clarity appeared to be less influential than the accessibility on perceived ease of use of online banking information system. Following three hypotheses were found statistically not significant, thus, they were rejected. Perceived ease of use will have a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness. Results shown in figure revealed that the standardized regression weight and critical ratio estimate for the perceived ease of use to the perceived usefulness were 0.093 and 1.641, respectively, showing statistically not significant path. It can be inferred from results that users do not relate ease of use with usefulness of online banking information system. Output quality will have a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness. As shown in figure, the standardised regression weight and critical ratio estimate for the output quality to the perceived usefulness was 0.077 and 1.177, respectively. This suggested that output quality do not have a significant effect on the perceived usefulness of online banking information system. Response time will have a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness. As shown in figure, the standardized regression weight and critical ratio for the response time to the perceived usefulness were 0.098 and 1.483 respectively, suggesting that the path was not statistically significant. Implying that users do not relate response time with usefulness of online banking information system."

Chol, in turn, was associated with the metabolic syndromoe variable. SpO2 was predictive of chol and had a relation with the metabolic syndrome variable that demonstrated a trend towards significance. The relation between SpO2 and the metabolic syndrome variable was statistically significant if chol was removed from the model.

The strongest highly significant direct influence on individual acceptance of biogas innovation is exerted by the personal innovativeness, with a path coefficient of 0.516\u204e\u204e\u204e. The negative influences of attitude towards biogas (\u22120.237\u204e\u204e) and externalities (\u22120.155\u204e) follow. The variance of the construct attitude of farmers towards the biogas innovation is explained by 54.7%. This is mainly due to the highly significant influence of personal innovativeness (\u22120.277\u204e\u204e\u204e) and externalities (0.596\u204e\u204e\u204e). The influence of facilitating conditions on the attitude towards biogas is not significant. Personal innovativeness is significantly influenced by individual land lease conditions, with a path coefficient of 0.161\u204e\u204e. However, only 3% of the variance in personal innovativeness could be explained by it."

The hypothesis that a higher level of SQ leads to a higher level of MQ is confirmed in the structural model with a high positive parameter estimate (coefficient: 0.76). More specifically, when the score of SQ goes up by 1 standard deviation, customer satisfaction goes up by 0.74 standard deviations. By contrast, the path coefficient of MQ on customer satisfaction is 0.48. The results suggest that customers are more sensitive to the SQ maintained by FM Company. In addition, efforts on SG and CF would be the most effective way to improve customer satisfaction level."

These results imply that older people (experienced drivers) are more satisfied with the usefulness of warning messages/advice displayed on VSL/CMS compared to young drivers. In addition, drivers who got traffic citation within the last three years are less satisfied with VSL/CMS. The results also revealed that familiarity with VSL positively affected drivers\u2019 satisfaction with VSL/CMS. However, familiarity with CMS was found to have insignificant effect on drivers\u2019 satisfaction with VSL/CMS. One possible explanation is that drivers in Central Florida are more familiar with CMS compared to VSL and hence, drivers, who are familiar with VSL, usually are aware of its importance for safety. Again, the results indicated that human factors has a significant positive effect on familiarity with VSL. This is logical as older drivers (or experienced drivers) are more familiar with VSL compared to young (novel) drivers."

    "text": "The variables that were defined as \u2018seat factors\u2019 most positively affected ride comfort. The personal fatigue variable was found out to negatively affect ride comfort. The seat factor (0.430) was indicated to positively affect ride comfort about two times more than the passenger fatigue factor of 0.373. In addition, it can be postulated that the measurement variables related to seat factors affect ride comfort more significantly than the variables related to passenger fatigue. In the order of precedence, seat pitch is indicated to affect the ride comfort with the value of 0.789, followed by seat width with the value of 0.702, seat shape (reclining seat) with the value of 0.561, and seat leg room with the value of 0.420. Therefore, the measurement variables related to seat factors, rather than passenger fatigue, were indicated to be a direct cause of ride discomfort.The tunneling effect factor was indicated to have no direct effect (the hypothesis was rejected) and was analyzed to have only indirect effect mediated by passenger fatigue. The results of this study indicated that, as shown on the ride comfort model, the complete reformation of seat factors is necessary for an improvement of ride comfort. Such improvement in the factors \u2013 seat pitch, width, shape, and leg room \u2013 of the seat appears to be critical."

The IP has an effect on Overall Framework Performance OFP. But the effect of SLP on AIP is so small, implying that dependence cannot be accepted and generalized. On the other hand, the collected data in our case do not support this hypothesis. The accuracy of SLP seems to be measured in terms of the accuracy of PIP. In other words, a high value for SLP does not result in a proper PIP. In summary, the relationship between SLP and AIP is not a direct relationship but a type 2 relationship with an intermediary part called PPS."

The higher the quality of the intergenerational relationship is, the lower the level of the elderly's depression symptom will be (\u03b2=\u22120.122). Moreover, family social support is negatively correlated with depression among the elderly (\u03b2=\u22120.026), indicating that the greater the family social support is, the lower the level of depression of the elderly will be. An intergenerational relationship can influence the depression of elderly through the mediating role of family social support. The elderly with a high-quality intergenerational relationship tend to receive considerable family social support (\u03b2=0.200), thereby leading to a reduced risk of depression symptoms."

Usual daily sleep duration was reduced by long weekly working hours, older age, higher BMI, and higher psychological distress. Confirmatory factor analysis verified the latent variable \u201cpsychological distress,\u201d measured by the variables (standardized factor loading) \u201csad\u201d, \u201cnervous\u201d, \u201crestless\u201d, \u201chopeless\u201d, \u201ceffort\u201d, and \u201cworthless\u201d. Psychological distress was slightly correlated with the number of weekly working hours (r = -0.02). Injury risk prediction. As shown in Figure 2, injury risk increased by weekly working hours (direct effect). And showing a direct effect of short usaul sleep on injury risk and at the same time a mediation of the effect of working hours on injury. High psychological distress and high BMI were also directly associated with an elevated injury risk. These variables had an additional indirect effect on occupational injury, mediated by sleep duration, so that an increase in psychological distress and BMI led to an increase in risk for short sleep duration, which in turn increased injury risk. Increasing age showed a weak association with shorter sleep duration but had no direct effect on occupational injury."

Additionally, circles with arrows pointing toward each observed variable represent the measurement error. Moreover, each latent variable is connected to every other variable by a curved two-headed arrow, which denotes that every variable covaries with other variables. The driver training level is the most significant factor that negatively affects the basic characteristics (factor load = 0.91). Anger due to slow driving is the main factor that influences the driving attitude (factor load = 0.90). In the structural model, the main factor that influences illegal driving actions is driving attitude, and the main factor that influences driver performance is basic characteristics. Therefore, to improve driving safety, drivers\u2019 characteristics and attitudes must be fully considered. Illegal driving actions are mostly associated with the accident frequency, and driver performance is mainly influenced by the driving speed. Slow-driving-induced anger and driving anger negatively affected driver performance and illegal driving actions."

After facility structure with a coefficient of 0.500, self-efficacy construct with a coefficient of 0.215 had the most effect on behavior. Knowledge had a significant indirect effect on outcome expectation; in fact, self-efficacy was a significant mediator. Self-efficacy was also a significant mediator between knowledge and facilities, meaning that knowledge indirectly affects facilities. On the other hand, knowledge has an effect on behavior through two mediators of self-efficacy and outcome expectation, which also has a significant effect. The outcome expectation variable is a significant mediator between self-efficacy and behavior."

The effect of Basic Competence on religious and spiritual competence was entirely indirect, mediated by Intermediate Competence, with no additional significant direct impact of Basic Competence on self-assessed religious and spiritual competence. Years of training and trainee age were associated with the Intermediate Competence variable, and ultimately with self-assessed religious and spiritual competence, but only through their association with Basic Competence (Fig. 2). The direct association of trainee age on Basic Competence was slightly negative. Older trainees reported slightly lower Basic Competence than did younger trainees after adjustment for years of training. The number of end-of-life discussions was associated with both of the latent competence variables, but affected religious and spiritual competence only through these mediating variables (Fig. 2). There was a positive direct effect on Basic Competence and a complex relationship with Intermediate Competence such that end-of-life discussion experience ultimately resulted in a positive impact on self-assessed religious and spiritual competence. Training program had a significant direct association with trainees\u2019 self-assessed competence in discussing religious and spiritual issues, but no association with the latent variables measuring Basic and Intermediate Competence. Trainees in the southeastern program felt more competent in the religious and spiritual domain than those in the northwestern program, but trainees were, on average, indistinguishable with regard to self-assessed competence in other communication skills."

    "text": "As shown in figure, all classroom environment dimensions had positive effects on outcomes. Five classroom environment dimensions had significant direct effects on academic efficacy (involvement, task orientation, investigation, differentiation and computer usage). Whereas teacher support, task orientation and equity had significant direct effects on attitude to subject, four classroom scales (viz. teacher support, task orientation, computer usage, and young adult ethos) had significant direct effects on attitude to computer use. In general, the strength and direction of the statistically significant path coefficients are plausible. For example, teacher support was a moderate, positive predictor of attitude to subject (\u03b2 = 0.33). Increased levels of involvement were positively related to academic efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.29) which itself was related positively to attitude to subject (\u03b2 = 0.21). That is, academic efficacy mediated the effect of involvement on attitude to subject. Task orientation was a significant, positive predictor of all three outcomes scales: academic efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.23), attitude to subject (\u03b2 = 0.16), and attitude to computer use (\u03b2 = 0.12). The effects of most classroom environment scales on attitude to subject were mediated by academic efficacy. For example, the effect of differentiation on attitude to subject was mediated by academic efficacy (0.19 \u00d7 0.21 = 0.04). Task orientation\u2019s direct effect on attitude to subject (\u03b2 = 0.16) was complemented by a small indirect effect (0.23 \u00d7 0.21 = 0.04) due to the path via academic efficacy. The mediating effect of academic efficacy on attitude to subject is particularly noteworthy with four classroom environment scales in the model having only indirect effects on attitude to subject (involvement, investigation, differentiation and computer usage). For example, computer usage did have an effect on attitude to subject but this effect was small due to the mediating effect of academic efficacy (0.13\u00d70.21 = .03). One important observation from figure is that attitude to computer use did not have a significant effect on attitude to subject. The most striking aspect of the final model is that none of the three antecedent variables had a significant direct effect on the three outcome variables. In fact six of the eight classroom environment scales in the model mediated the effect of antecedents on outcomes. All antecedents had positive effects on classroom environment. The effect of grade on outcomes was particularly weak with a sole path to all three outcomes via computer usage. Home computer and internet access had a greater effect on attitude to subject than on attitude to computer use."

The data indicates that perceived usefulness has a direct effect on behavioral intention to use MHS (H1: 0.22). While the perceived ease of use has a significant direct impact on behavioral intention to use MHS (H2a: 0.48), it also has an indirect effect on behavioral intention to use through the mediator of perceived usefulness; meanwhile, perceived ease of use also has an extremely strong effect on perceived usefulness (H2b: 0.69). Consistent with our hypotheses, the results indicate that compatibility not only has a direct effect on behavioral intention to use MHS (H3a: 0.27) and perceived usefulness (H3b: 0.32), but also has strong significant and positive effects on both perceived ease of use (H3c: 0.40) and MHS self-efficacy (H3d: 0.41). Additionally, while MHS self-efficacy has direct effect on perceived usefulness (H4a: 0.34) and has very strong effect on perceived ease of use (H4b: 0.47), technical support and training has also an extremely significant direct impact on MHS self-efficacy (H5c: 0.60).

The empirical test of the model confirms the direct path of two of the three coping styles latent variables on Resilience. Positive and emotional coping affect, positively and negatively respectively, resilience. Resilience directly and negatively affects the stress spectrum domains symptoms, partially mediating the impact of coping styles; in fact emotional coping shows even a direct positive impact on the outcome. Positive and emotional coping styles result to be positively correlated as well as emotional and disengagement coping styles."

Community support has a great infuence on perceived playfulness. Perceived playfulness is also an important factor that afects student acceptance, which refects the disciplinary characteristics of science curriculum from one side. Perceived playfulness of blended learning in science curriculum not only has an obvious direct impact on student acceptance, but also afects perceived usefulness through perceived ease-of-use, and then afects student acceptance through perceived usefulness. In the fnal model obtained in this study, neither perceived ease-of-use nor perceived usefulness shows strong infuence on acceptance."

The significant influence of the access divide on e-government use was proven by the path coefficient of 0.208 and t-value of 1.367. The path coefficient and t-value for the influence of capability divide on e-government use were 0.279 and 2.135, respectively. On the other hand, the influence of the innovativeness divide on e-government use had a path coefficient of 0.275 and the t-value of 2.668. In other words, the influence of the innovativeness divide on e-government use was the strongest among other factors of the digital divide. The results confirm that the three variables of digital divide took the form of a sequential process. The results demonstrate the strong influence of the access divide on the capability divide (t-value of 32.985) and of the capability divide on the innovativeness divide (t-value of 20.748). The influence of the digital divide on e-government system success was also significant for the innovativeness divide, the capability divide, and the access divide, with the t-values of 2.668, 2.135, and 1.367, respectively."

According to the data (Fig. 2), the direct effects of leisure motivation and leisure involvement on leisure satisfaction were .13 and .84, respectively. Leisure motivation had a strong significant direct effect on leisure involvement (.93). However, the direct effect of leisure motivation on leisure satisfaction was not significant. The relationship between leisure motivation and leisure satisfaction is mediated by leisure involvement."

The belief of his supporters in the importance of the polls and money in elections increases together with the increase of these both cognitive domains. The lack of influence of Media on Emotional feelings means that American voters present a coherent approach to voting behavior and are relatively resistant to affect. The perceived broadcast messages are not distorted by evoked emotions."

    "text": "This attitude variable has two components: the cognitive and the affective, indicated as \u2018\u2018Cognitive\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Affective\u2019\u2019 in the diagrams. As can be seen from the high positive (0.57\u20130.80) path coefficients for the cognitive component in the path diagram, cognitive has a strong influence on all of the measured variables. Similarly, as shown by the positive (0.53\u20130.79) values of the path coefficient for the affective component has a strong influence on its measured variables. The second order of this attitude test structure is the relationship between these two latent variables with overall \u2018\u2018Attitude toward Chemistry.\u2019\u2019 The path coefficient from attitude toward chemistry to cognitive is 0.89 and from attitude toward chemistry to affective is 0.93. The variance in attitude toward chemistry explained by the cognitive component is 78%, and by the attitude component is 86%. TMI addresses three basic concepts, bond energy, phase changes, and ionic/covalent bonds. Each concept is measured using three items. As shown in figure the test items loaded well on their respective scales. However, the scale of bond energy does not load well under the general construct of chemistry conceptual knowledge, since its loadings is -0.06 for the model. For the other two concepts, the loadings is higher, 0.85 for phase changes in model and for ionic/covalent bond the loadings is 0.71 for this model. This situation indicates that the bond energy concept, as measured by the TMI, does not really function well with the other two concepts as an indicator of overall understanding. For this model, the correlation between math ability and prior conceptual knowledge is 0.61, between math ability and attitude toward chemistry is 0.29, and between attitude toward chemistry and prior conceptual knowledge 0.48. Model 2 assessed the relationship of achievement with three predictors. First, the path coefficient between math ability and achievement is 0.36, which indicates a strong positive effect. The path coefficient from attitude toward chemistry to achievement is 0.10, which indicates a small positive effect on achieve ment. The path coefficient between prior conceptual knowledge and achievement is 0.50, which indicates a moderate positive effect of the conceptual knowledge on achievement."

As shown in the models, procurement system would have a positive effect on information cost is supported. Information cost is significantly influenced by procurement system at \u03b2 = 0.18. However, information cost fully mediates the relationship between procurement system and transaction cost. Procurement system has a substantial effect on project procurement cost at \u03b2 = 0.13. Project procurement cost is fully mediated the relationship between procurement system and transaction cost. Procurement system has a significant effect on contract administration cost at \u03b2 = 0.09. Administration cost mediates the relationship between procurement system and transaction cost.

System quality had a significant impact on user satisfaction(0.31), but had no significant effect on use(0.05). Consequently, information quality exhibited a stronger effect than system quality and service quality on use and user satisfaction, respectively. In addition, use had a significant influence on both user satisfaction and perceived net benefit(0.26 and 0.36, respectively). Finally, user satisfaction appeared to be a significant determinant of perceived net benefit(0.35). Altogether, this model accounted for 40% of the variance in perceived net benefit, with use exerting a stronger direct effect than user satisfaction on perceived net benefit. Seventy percent of the variance in user satisfaction was explained by information quality, system quality, service quality, and use, while 21% of the variance in use was explained by information quality, system quality, and service quality."

However, the direct link between parental support and academic achievement is weak for both sexes (girls: \u03b2 = .06, t > 1.96; boys: \u03b2 = .04, t > 1.96). The relationship between parental support and school achievement is therefore to the most extent indirect, through school effort. The standardized direct effect of parental monitoring on academic achievement is \u03b2 = .13 among adolescent girls and \u03b2= .15 among boys. Furthermore, parental monitoring has a direct and positive relationship with school effort among girls (\u03b2 = .08, t > 1.96) and boys (\u03b2 = .11, t > 1.96). The standardized total effect of time spent with parents on school effort is \u03b2= .31 among adolescent girls and \u03b2= .25 among boys. Nevertheless, the direct relationship between time spent with parents and academic achievement is non-significant for both adolescent boys and girls (\u03b2 = \u2013.03, t < 1.96 for girls, and \u03b2 = .03, t < 1.96 for boys). Thus, all the impact of time spent with parents on school achievement in our model operates through school effort among both adolescent girls and boys. We also measure the direct relationship between school effort and academic achievement. Unsurprisingly, school effort was very strongly and directly related to academic achievement among girls (\u03b2 = .51, t > 1.96) and boys (\u03b2 = .44, t > 1.96)."

Perceived behavioral control was the main predictor of medication adherence, which positively predicted medication adherence directly and indirectly. Stronger perceived behavioral control was associated with better medication adherence. Affective attitude and subjective norm were indirectly associated with medication adherence through intention. Social support exerted an indirect effect on medication adherence by means of subjective norm, demonstrating that better social support of the patients would relate to higher subjective norm through which stronger intention was obtained subsequently and better medication adherence was gained ultimately."

The path between lack of commitment (LC) to construction delay (CD) with statistically significant coefficient of 0.03 does not support the hypothesis. The hypothetical path between contractor\u2019s inefficiency (CNI) and construction delay (CD) with relatively smaller path coefficient (0.20) at an acceptable significance level does not support the hypothesis either. The link between the contractor\u2019s inefficiency (CNI) and improper planning (IP) was found to be supported in reverse order with a statistically significant negative path coefficient (\u20130.53). The path from client\u2019s influence (CI) to improper planning (IP) with a path coefficient of 0.48 was found to be marginally significant."

Traumatic events were negatively associated with trusting relationship, which in turn was negatively associated with depression. HIV-related stigma was negatively related with future orientation and perceived social support, which in turn were positively related to trusting relationship. Thus, traumatic events had significant indirect effects on depression through trusting relationships; HIV-related stigma also had significant indirect effects on depression through future orientation, perceived social support and trusting relationships. In addition, HIV-related stigma was strongly correlated with traumatic events."

Participants that are more knowledgeable about financial topics are more likely to engage in desirable financial behaviors than those that are less knowledgeable. Moreover, financial attitude scores are positively related to financial behavior scores. Finally, the relationship between money ethic and financial behavior is significant for the behavioral dimension of the money ethic construct. Those who budget their money carefully display more desirable financial behaviors. No significant relationship is found between the success dimension of money ethic and financial behavior (\u03b2 \u00bc \u22120.025, pW0.1) and the affective dimension of money construct had only a marginally significant effect on financial behavior (\u03b2 \u00bc \u22120.098, p \u00bc 0.061). Accordingly, participants who consider that money is not evil display marginally more desirable financial behaviors (Figure 2)."

Experience quality has a significant positive effect on both perceived value and satisfaction (\u03b31=0.70, t-value = 14.59 and \u03b32 =0.57, t-value =8.52, respectively), but not on behavioral intentions (and \u03b33 =0.06, t-value =0.82). The perceived value, as hypothesized, has significant positive effects on satisfaction (\u03b21 =0.30, t-value =5.02) as well as behavioral intention (\u03b22 =0.25, t-value =4.37). Finally, the satisfaction has a significantly positive effect on behavioral intentions (\u03b23 =0.57, t-value =6.69). First, the direct effect of experience quality on perceived value (0.70) is greater than it is on satisfaction (0.57), while no direct effect of experience quality on behavioral intentions is found. Second, although both direct effects of perceived value and satisfaction on behavioral intentions are identified, the latter (0.57) is greater than the former (0.25). With respect to indirect effects, third, the effect of experience quality on behavioral intentions mediated by perceived value. Additionally, perceived value has a direct effect (0.25) as well as an indirect effect (0.17) mediated by satisfaction on behavioral intentions."

In the case of the data, the correlation coefficient is at 0.357. Further, the result does not show that supplier selection strategy influences organizational performance.

The score for absence of punishment and restriction \u2013 homeii \u2013 was the only indicator that was not significantly correlated with the construct parenting style (standardized factor loading = 0.10; p-value = 0.187). The factor loadings for the other indicators showed moderate to strong magnitude (varying from 0.38 to 0.90). The physical-environmental indicator is the one that most heavily influences the CDI (standardized estimate = 0.50). In addition to the physical-environmental factor, the nutritional factor (standardized estimate = 0.16) was significantly associated with CDI (Figure 3). The latent variable parenting style was not directly associated with CDI (p-value = 0.64), neither were the child\u2019s sex and age (respectively, p-values = 0.10 and 0.60)."

Results confirmed that Disengaged parenting was related to sexual and nonsexual child abuse, and, along with nonsexual abuse, to greater insecure attachment. Paths from sexual abuse and insecure attachment to psychological symptoms were also significant. The link between Disengaged parenting and psychological symptomatology was explained by three significant indirect effects."

Similarly, nursing quality of care and leadership ability and support had direct positive effects (0.32 and 0.16, respectively) and indirect effects via other variables. On the other hand, knowledge perception, self-regulation, workplace participation, and disaster training and disaster experience had only direct effects on perception of disaster preparedness. Nurses\u2019 self-regulation was significantly influenced by nurses\u2019 skills perception(0.47), leadership ability and support (0.39), and nursing quality of care (0.14).

In this model, the relation between addictiveness and obligatory attitudes toward exercise was weak, but significant. Additionally, the path from obsessive\u2013compulsiveness to obligatory attitudes toward exercise was modestly significant. Obligatory attitudes toward exercise was strongly related to exercise behavior. Of particular interest was the direct effect between obligatory attitudes toward exercise and eating/weight restriction when weight-related reason for exercise was evaluated. The above significant relations suggested that weight-related reasons for exercise partially mediated the relation between obligatory attitudes toward exercise and eating/weight restriction."

    "text": "The correlation coefficients between greenspace exposure and its measured variables (GE1, GE2\u3000and GE3) are 0.70, 0.87 and 0.08 respectively, suggesting that \u201cGE1\u201d and \u201cGE2\u201d are more closely related to participant\u2019s daily greenspace exposures. Greenspace exposure has a direct positive effect on mental health (0.21) and social health (0.17). However, greenspace exposure is not associated with physical health (0.01). These direct effects on the three dimensions of health indicate that participants\u2019 psychological condition and social interactions are significantly better for participants who were exposed to more greenspace than those who were exposed to more greenspace-poor areas. In addition, the impact of greenspace exposure on mental health is more obvious than its impact on social health. The indirect effects of daily greenspace exposure on individual health are realized through physical activity, the mediator variable. The correlation coefficients between physical activity and its measured variables (PA1, PA2 and PA3) are 0.83, 0.14, and 0.82, respectively, suggesting that \u201cPA1\u201d and \u201cPA3\u201d of physical activity have great influences on the level of physical activity undertaken by participants. Daily greenspace exposure level has a strong relationship with physical activity level. Physical activity has a significant positive effect on physical health (0.13) and mental health (0.13). However, physical activity is not associated with social health (0.05), so this outcome is excluded from further analysis. There are the indirect effects of daily greenspace exposure on participants\u2019 physical health and mental health through physical activity. By comparing the results of indirect effects and direct effects of daily greenspace exposure on health, it can be observed that the effects of daily greenspace exposure on physical health and social health changed greatly after adding the mediating variable of physical activity, indicating that physical activity plays a mediating role in the relationship between greenspace exposure and health."

The results show that trust and cooperation had a direct effect on the effectiveness, while conflict, communication, balanced power, and shared values had indirect effects on the effectiveness."

The results found that both enjoyment in helping others and knowledge self-efficacy were found to positively influence knowledge donating and knowledge collecting. Furthermore, the top management support variable was found to be influential in knowledge donating and knowledge collecting. However, the results show that organizational rewards had no significant relationship with employee willingness to donate and knowledge collecting. Moreover, ICT use was found to positively influence knowledge collecting, but the linking ICT use and knowledge donating was not supported. Finally, the impact of firm innovation capability was found to be strongly positively associated with employee willingness to donate and knowledge collecting."

Aptitude for Medicine is identified by four variables (BS, PS, VR, WS) that are all subtests of the MCAT. Three of the measured vari ables (Step1 USMLE , Step 2 USMLE, Step 3 USMLE) also serve to identify Performance in Medicine that are all relevant to a performance in medicine construct. There is a direct path coefficient (0.47) from Aptitude for Medicine to Performance in Medicine that confirms the \u201ccausal\u201d direction. The correlations between General Achievement (r= .41) and Performance in Medicine and Aptitude for Medicine (r = .25) all confirm the expected relationship. The General Achievement factor has a significant path coefficient (0.36) from the exogenous variables age and ethnicity. Ethnicity has a small (.22) path coefficient on Performance in Medicine but nonetheless influences this variable. All of the latent variables are related as predicted, and the crucial path coefficient from Aptitude for Medicine to Performance in Medicine is significant (path coefficient = 0.47). The intercorrelations among the other latent variables are all significant. These results support the overall model and the particulars of the predicted relationships as well."

Social presence was found to be a more important determinant of sociability (\u03b2 = 0.74), utilitarian (\u03b2 = 0.54) and hedonic (\u03b2 = 49). Hedonic was an important factor in determining compulsive use (\u03b2 = 0.39) for male students. Also, sociability was an important factor (\u03b2 = \u20130.22) in the negative direction. We also found that utilitarian (\u03b2 = 0.10) was not important in compulsive use. Finally, we found compulsive use impacted all three performance levels: academic (\u03b2 = 0.67), physical (\u03b2 = 0.69) and social (\u03b2 = 0.67)."

More importantly, the path association between environmental performance and competitive advantage is strong and highly significant (b = 1.87). Secondly, managerial innovation (H2b) and process innovation (H2a) are positively associated with environmental performance (b = 1.26 and 1.04, respectively). However, managerial innovation (H2c), surprisingly, did not show a significant relationship with environmental performance(b = -0.13). In other words, green product and process innovations may be more effective than green managerial innovations in improving a company\u2019s environmental performance. This might be because managerial innovation has a more indirect effect on the measurement of environmental performance, compared to the other two types of inno vation. Managerial innovation relates to high level strategy and hence it is positively linked to competitive advantage. The results imply that managerial innovation may have a moderating effect on product and process innovation. Thirdly, the associations between greening the supplier and product innovation (H1a), process innovation (H1b), and managerial innovation (H1c) are also highly significant (c = 0.99, 0.93, and 0.95, respectively). Likewise, the path associations between greening the supplier and competitive advantage (c = 0.99). In addition, product innovation (H3a), process innovation (H3b) and managerial innovation (H3c) all have positive path associations with competitive advantage (b = 0.59, 0.6, and 0.72, respectively). This implies that a company can gain competitive advantage through the implementation of green product innovation, green process innovation and green managerial innovation. Finally, the associations between managerial innovation and product innovation (H7c) and process innovation (H7b) are significant (b = 1.04 and 0.94, respectively). Similarly, the path association between green product innovation and green process innovation (b = 0.92, p < 0.001) provides support for H7a. Green product innovation therefore contributes to green process innovation, and green managerial innovation contributes to both green product innovation and green process innovation, as shown in figure. More importantly, the intervening variable of innovation contributes to the relationship between greening the supplier and competitive advantage."

Data also support that a significant positive correlation was found between engagement with a second screen device and second screen use. Data indicate team identification was significantly related to both engagement with a second screen device and second screen use. Here, data indicate a significant positive relationship between device efficacy and attitude toward the second screen device and engagement with a second screen device. However, the relationship between device efficacy and second screen use was not statis tically significant. Engagement with second screen device was significantly related to attitude toward second screen devices but not significantly related to second screen device use. While team identification was significantly related to engagement with second screen device, it was not related to second screen use. Moreover, although device efficacy did not predict second screen use, it was significantly related to attitude towards the second screen devices and engagement with the second screen device as predicted. Finally, attitude toward second screen devices was not significantly related to second screen use. Finally, from this model, 22% of the variance in engagement with a second screen device was explained while 16% of the variance in attitude toward second screen devices and 6% of the variance in second screen use was explained."

According to the data in Fig. 2, the direct effect of sexual knowledge on safe sex behaviour was .06 and  .15, which did not reach the .05 significance level. The direct effect of sexual attitudes on safe sex behaviour was .03, which did not reach the .05 significance level. Therefore, there was no meaningful indirect effect of sexual knowledge on safe sex behaviour. The direct effect of sexual knowledge (pregnancy knowledge and sexual physiological) on sexual attitudes was  .62 and  .79, respectively. Both reached the .05 significance level. The findings indicated that adolescents with higher sexual knowledge have lower sexual attitudes. Furthermore, sexual knowledge and sexual attitudes were irrelevant to safe sex behaviour."

As hypothesized, Fatalists have a negative effect on Attitudes. However there is no effect on Norms. In addition, a correlation path between Fatalists and Intention1 was introduced to improve model fit. Results of the mediation analysis showed that Individualist and Egalitarian were totally mediated through Attitudes and Norms because the direct effects of the values on Intention disappear when Attitudes and Norms are taken into account. In contrast, Fatalist had just a direct effect on Attitudes and an indirect effect on Intention but there is no mediation since there is no significant direct effect between Fatalist and Intention indicating that there is nothing to mediate. With other words, to affect the Intention the value types need to be processed via Attitudes and Norms."

To our surprise, we find no link between self-presentation benefits and self-disclosure in OSNs. As expected, perceived privacy risk has a significant negative impact on the self-disclosure. Furthermore, our results show that the perceived control enhances the user trust in the OSN provider. Interestingly, we find that trust in other OSN members failed to alleviate perceived privacy risks in any meaningful way."

These results supported the hypotheses that the DMZ-perceived value in terms of \u2018functional value,\u2019 \u2018overall value\u2019 and \u2018emotional value\u2019 would have a positive effect on DMZ tour satisfaction. The magnitude of coefficient scores indicated that overall value has the largest influence on DMZ tour satisfaction among the perceived values. In the path coefficient from the DMZ tour satisfaction to recommendations, it was found that the completely standardized coefficient was statistically significant (0.29). This result indicates that DMZ tour satisfaction had a significant impact on recommendations of the DMZ tour to others. Finally, the new proposed path relationship from the \u2018overall value\u2019 to the recommendations of the DMZ tour to others showed a statistically significant result (0.43). Thus, \u2018overall value\u2019 had a positively direct relationship with recommendations to others for the DMZ tour."

It is further revealed that the pathway from DSM to DC and to ICC is the most explanatory and influential. Likewise, ID can be reflected and explained by two pathways \u2013 CP and MMC \u2013 and the relation between those two pathways and indirect contact are significant; their standard coefficients are 0.93 and 0.75, respectively.

In addition, human factors (i.e., higher age, longer driving experience, less number of traffic citations and higher usage of freeways/2-lane roads) was found out to positively affect drivers\u2019 responses to VSL instructions under very light or light fog. However, roadway type had no direct effect on drivers\u2019 compliance with VSL instruc tions under very light or light fog. Similarly, the results indicated that drivers\u2019 satisfaction with VSL/CMS positively affected drivers\u2019 behavior (following VSL instructions) under medium or heavy fog. Also, human factors was found out to positively affect drivers\u2019 responses to VSL instructions under medium or heavy fog. Moreover, it was found that roadway type positively affected drivers\u2019 compliance with VSL instructions under medium or heavy fog. This imply that drivers tend to follow VSL instructions under medium or heavy fog while driving on 2-lane roads compared to driving on freeways possibly due to the absence of medians. In addition, the results revealed that human factors has indirect effect on drivers\u2019 responses to VSL instructions under reduced visibility conditions as it positively affected drivers\u2019 satisfaction with VSL/CMS which subsequently positively affected drivers\u2019 compliance with VSL instructions under adverse visibility conditions."

Model also indicated that stress management had a direct relation with depression. The high score on the stress management means less ability to handle stress, indicating that individuals with reduced ability to handle stress suffer more from depression."

The statistically significant relationships are shown with solid lines, and, for a cleaner display, other non-significant relationships are concealed. In terms of the technical aspect, EU had a relationship with AC. On the other hand, CO had a strong relationship to all of the factors in the content aspect of the teachers\u2019 preferences, including AC, RE and MS. Moreover, CO was the significant predictor explaining TG and IL in the cognitive aspect, indicating that a continuous learning procedure is an important factor for TG and IL, in the teachers\u2019 views. In addition, from the aspect of content, MS was the mediator explaining the variation in TG, SN and IL. This result indicates that the provision of MS in mobile learning environments plays an important role when the teachers develop more cognitive activities in mobile learning environments."

    "text": "We found five factors that significantly influenced the percent removed, though together they explained only a modest proportion of the decision\u2019s variance (R2 = 0.120). Case factors even as aggregated to the worker level were of most importance: Percent Removed was increased in part by greater average Risk assessment ( 0.263) and Low Income (0.103). On the other hand, the percent removed was decreased by higher PHISP (\u22120.099). Two Organizational factors were associated with lower percent removed: perceived organizational Support (\u22120.131) and Workload and Resources being perceived as unmanageable (\u22120.163). Among case factors, only Risk Assessment was affected by other variables in the model, although it was not much explained by them (R2 = .053). Low Income (0.116) and the caseworker\u2019s External Reference (0.093) influenced their risk assess ments to be higher risk, whereas higher Case Skills (\u22120.082) and a greater PAM (\u22120.193) or PHISP (\u22120.182) families on the worker\u2019s caseload influenced their risk assessments to be lower risk. Among Organizational factors, about a fifth of the variance (R2 = .209) of Support was explained by the model. It was promoted by a perception of availability of Services (0.305), and detracted from by SEN (\u22120.133), and by Workload and resources (\u22120.247). About 10% ofthe variance of Services was explained by the model(R2 = .107). Interpersonal Skills (0.239) and Disposition decision is based upon risk assessment (0.121) increased perception that services were sufficiently available, whereas V58 (\u22120.155) and greater SEN (\u22120.099) detracted from it. Also 10% of the variance of perceived Workload and Resources was explained by the model (R2 = 0.102). Higher levels of Interpersonal Skills determined in part (0.173) a perception that workload was too high and/or that resources to adequately perform the job were insufficient. The construct most fully explained by the model was Worry about Liability (R2 = .447, which can be interpreted to indicate that nearly 45% of the latent construct\u2019s variance was determined by other variables in the model). Worry about Liability was directly influenced by Difficult Situations (0.409) and indirectly by Support (\u22120.376). The direct influence of Difficult Situations on Worry about Liability suggests that caseworkers who are uncomfortable working with hostile or difficult clients are more likely to be concerned about the personal consequences of their decisions. Workers also tended to be more worried about liability if they had more SEN (0.149), greater Case Skills (0.171), and assessed their cases as risk assessment (0.108). Higher levels on the Supervision and Work Unit factor also were associated with more Worry about Liability (0.104). About 40% of the variance (R2 = .392) of the latent construct Difficult Situations was explained by the model, which is directly affected by an Internal Reference orientation ( 0.596), Workload and Resources being perceived as unmanageable (0.168), and Worry that CPS makes things worse for the child (0.125). On the other hand, Difficult Situations was lessened by the caseworker being male (\u22120.155), by having more of an External Reference orientation (\u22120.200), and by having a relatively high level of Case Skills (\u22120.096). About a fifth of the variance (R2 = 0.202) of Internal Reference was explained by the model, specifically by V58 (0.408), and Professional collateral information is more reliable (0.085). Interpersonal Skills, however, negatively influenced Internal Reference (\u22120.141). Less of the variance of External Reference was explained by the model (R2 = 0.129). However, it was similarly influenced by Worry that CPS sometimes makes things worse for the child (0.351)."

The variable SN has the most impact on the smoking intention, whereas PBC reduces smoking intention, as well as the smoking behavior, but the strength of its determination is lower than that of SN. Lastly, attitudes seem to have a weak impact on the smoking intention."

Hypothesis indicating that visual spatial imagery has a positive effect on the spatial situational model, is also confirmed: Individuals with a high spatial ability produced a stronger spatial situational model (.24). Also, the formation of a feeling of spatial presence, could be confirmed. Individuals who generated a spatial situational model experienced spatial presence more strongly (.45). Involvement had a positive effect on spatial presence (.27). Suspension of disbelief was positively associated with spatial presence (.24) providing support for hypothesis; that is, individuals who did not pay attention to contradictions in the virtual environment or ignored them had a more comprehensive experience of spatial presence. Furthermore, domain specific interest was found to be a positive predictor of involvement ( .35). Finally, we argued in hypothesis that spatial presence consists of two dimensions: self-location and possible actions. As shown in figure, spatial presence does indeed comprise self-location and possible actions. Individuals who experience spatial presence have the feeling of being located in the virtual environment (.90) and feel that they can act in the virtual environment (.72)."

For the other two concepts, the loadings is higher, 0.84 for phase changes in model and for ionic/covalent bond the loadings is 0.72 for the model. This situation indicates that the bond energy concept, as measured by the TMI, does not really function well with the other two concepts as an indicator of overall understanding. For this model, the path coefficient from math ability to achievement increases to 0.62, a much larger effect, and from attitude toward chemistry to 0.28, a slightly larger but still small effect."

According to the path coefficients, organic carbon had a negligible effect on nitrogen uptake (-.03). Nitrogen uptake & nitrogen content performed moderate effect on yield (.30) & (.34) respectively. Whereas, nitrogen content has been strong effect on nitrogen uptake (.63). There is significant interaction for path coefficient between the nitrogen uptake as a dependent variable and nitrogen content as independent variables and nitrogen content on rice yield has also statistically significant interaction. Therefore, nitrogen content in soil is the much more important as comparison to other selecting variables during consideration of direct relationships. While considering the indirect effects, nitrogen content in soil on rice yield was the highest indirect strength. Thus, while nitrogen content in soil has a strong direct effect on nitrogen uptake, but it is also had a greatest magnitude of indirect strengths for rice yield. Expressing it in the another way, nitrogen content in soil exhibiting a strong direct link as well as exhibited a indirect influence through the other predictor variables."

The Corruption Perception Index (correlation 0.95), shadow economy survey (0.87) and cash quota (0.70) are the stronger indicators. The tax cheating survey (0.14) is the weakest indicator with nearly no influence, which confirms the previous assumptions. The latent variable, wealth a development level is constructed with two stronger indicators Human Development Index (0.97) and GDP per capita (0.93), and the weaker indicator Gini coefficient (\u22120.47) for inequality, which implies that more wealth reduces the shadow economy. The latent variable administrative system is constructed with 14 indicators,2 which are mainly based on surveys concerning the quality of institutions, regulations and bureaucratic procedures with the result, that a better administrative system sustainably reduces the shadow economy. The latent variable, constitutional trust and values is based on 11 indicators,3 with surveys and indices concerning the trust in constitutional functions such as the rule of law (0.96), democratic accountability (0.85) or regime durability (0.71). This latent variable has a high negative correlation (\u22120.89) but only a minor coefficient (\u22120.07) with shadow economy. Countries with higher constitutional trust and values have less shadow economy, but this influence disappears in the mul tivariate model, because the remaining latent variables already include all useful information. The three independent latent variables have a high multicollinearity between 0.81 and 0.90, meaning it is not exactly possible to distinguish their influence on the shadow economy. All of the three independent latent variables could be combined into a single variable, Overall state. The partialR2 = 0.90 was calculated using the reduced model and it shows that the Overall State explains major parts of the variations of the shadow economy."

For the effect of contextual factors of networking, acquisition of skill and technology, and government and public policies on internal innovation performance, networking positively influenced innovation capacity (0.152). However, networking did not represent a statistically significant effect on internal innovation capacity. In addition to networking, skill and technology acquisition was positively associated with internal innovation capacity (0.647). However, the link between government and public policies and internal innovation capacity(0.103) was not statistically insignificant. As mentioned above, the results indicated that a contextual variable such as skill and technology acquisition was a crucial factor fostering internal innovation capacity, as expected. The path results showed that innovation performance was in part positively influenced by networking activities through inernal innovation capacity. However, this link was not statistically significant. The results show a partial mediation of internal innovation capacity in the significant relationship between their innovation performance and the acquisition of skills and technology. The acquisition of skills and technology influenced internal innovation capacity directly, and had an indirect positive effect through internal innovation capacity. The path coefficients also show the positive influence of government and public policies in the relationship between innovation performance and internal innovation capacity; that is, innovation performance was positively influenced by government and public policies through their internal innovation capacity."

In more detail, job characteristics have a significant positive direct effect on both professional commitment and organisational commitment, as well as on internal work motivation. However, job characteristics affect job satisfaction and turnover intention only indirectly. Internal work motivation also has a positive direct effect on professional and organizational commitment, and as was the case with job characteristics, influences turnover intentions only indirectly. On the other hand, organizational commitment has a fairly strong positive effect on job satisfaction, which is stronger than that of professional commitment on that construct. Organizational commitment also influences turnover intention directly, while professional commitment only has a weak indirect effect on turnover intention to quit. Moreover, the two commitment forms have been found to be strongly and positively correlated as initially hypothesized. Finally, job satisfaction has a fairly strong negative effect on turnover intention, confirming the initial hypothesis."

    "text": "Information, convenience, and social interaction showed significant direct effects on the duration of time on a Web site. The only exception was the entertainment motivation, which did not show a significant relation with duration of time on a Web site. On the other hand, the model revealed that duration of time had nonsignificant direct effects on the human\u2013message interaction, the human\u2013human interaction, and attitude toward the site. The information motivation had a positive effect on human\u2013message interaction, which suggests that those who have high information motivation tend to click a series of hyperlinks as a voluntary exposure to further information provided on advertiser Web sites. The social interaction motivations had a positive effect on human\u2013human interaction . It is interesting to note that the social-interaction motivation had a negative effect on human\u2013message interaction . Convenience motivation had a positive effect on human\u2013human interaction, but little effect on human\u2013message interaction. The results imply that those who have high convenience motivation are more likely to use interactive features promoting interactions among people rather than human\u2013message interactive features.Attitude toward the site was more strongly affected by the human\u2013human interaction than the human\u2013message interaction, while the human\u2013message interaction also had a significant direct effect on the variable. This result indicates that if a Web site gets visitors interacting with other people, it is expected that this site can achieve more positive outcomes from the visitors. The causal relations between interactivity and attitude toward the site were significantly positive. Attitude toward the brand was strongly affected by attitude toward the site. In addition, the indirect effect of attitude toward the site on purchase intention via attitude toward the brand was also significantly positive. On the other hand, attitude toward the brand had a strong effect on purchase in tention."

Image of the company, perceived value and perceived quality have positive and significant impact on customer satisfaction. Image of the company has the highest impact on customer satisfaction as a score of 0.889. The second important factor was perceived quality. Perceived quality construct evaluates customization and reliability of a given product or service. The results also revealed that customer satisfaction was significantly related to loyalty. In a similar vein, a strong and positive relationship has also been found between perceived quality and perceived value. Finally, no support has been found between customer expectations and perceived value, image and customer satisfaction, and customer expectations and customer satisfaction constructs. In addition that the highest score among constructs was found between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty as a score of 0.973."

The positive and direct role of brand loyalty in affecting brand equity was accepted as its coefficient was significant and had the appropriate sign. However, the other three constructs (perceived quality, brand association, and brand awareness) had very low or negative parameter estimates and were deemed not statistically significant. Therefore, as far as the present empirical research is concerned, perceived quality, brand awareness, and brand associations do not have a direct significant influence on brand equity."

However, another relationship, that travel satisfaction is affected by the push motivation, was not supported by the data, indicated by the completely standardized coefficient score of 0.41. Finally, the new proposed path relationship from the push motivation to destination loyalty shows a significant result, indicated by the completely standardized coefficient of 0.41. Thus, push motivation has a positively direct relationship with destination loyalty."

The specific findings of the survey and the interpretation of the results obtained in the context of objectives as set are summarized below: The standardized regression weight takes the highest value (0.913) for the positive effect of information technology on SCM competitive advantage. From an analysis of the supported hypotheses, we conclude that information technology helps to achieve the logistic effectiveness and encourages the SCM competitive advantage. Information technology is a key capability for operational effectiveness, which enhances the SCM competitive advantage, which further accelerates better customer relationship and supplier relationship."

Perceived behavioural control has a positive impact on entrepreneurial intentions independent from the regional context. Besides, there is a significant path coefficient between subjective norms and entrepreneurial intention. Closer valuation has significant positive effects over attitude to behaviour and subjective norms, as it was assumed in the theory section. An additional non-hypothesized relationship was found from closer valuation to entrepreneurial intention. This would mean that, independently from their attitude or behavioural control, those individuals whose closer environment values entrepreneurship more positively will have a higher startup intention. On the other hand, social valuation has a significant effect over subjective norms and perceived behavioural control, as hypothesized above."

However, relations between constructs are stronger (with a major path coefficient) for the segment of consumers willing to consume GMF. Therefore, we can state that attitudes towards biotechnology rely more on perceived benefits of science and technology for people willing to consume GMF. Moreover, attitudes towards biotechnology have a major influence on perceived benefits of GMF for consumers willing to consume GM food and attitudes towards GM medical applications are significantly negative related to perceived benefits of GMF only for the group willing to consume GM food. On the contrary, a positive approach towards the environment has a significant negative impact on perceived benefits of science and technology. Finally, positive attitudes towards GM medical applications were considered to have a negative influence on perceived benefits of GMF."

It was also observed that noise disturbance had a significant, negative influence on satisfaction with the environment. Speech privacy had been shown to have a significant relationship with job satisfaction. Consequently, a lack of speech privacy in open-plan offices results in lower job satisfaction. Furthermore, the relationship between speech privacy and satisfaction with the work environment was found to be statistically significant. There was no significant relationship between noise sensitivity and noise disturbance. Moreover, it was also found that noise sensitivity had a positive relationship with speech privacy. The present result shows that the duration of disturbing noise had a significant influence on job satisfaction. The duration of disturbing noise had no significant effect on health symptoms. It was observed that the relationship between satisfaction with the environment and job satisfaction was not significant."

Consequently, experience was found to have both direct and indirect effect on divers\u2019 underwater behaviour, with diving attitude acting as a mediator. Though personality was found to have significant relationship with diving attitude, the mediating effect of diving attitude was not significant in the personality and underwater behaviour relationship."

    "text": "Hypothesis predicts that EE will be positively related to IU. The results uphold this. The path coefficient (\u03b2) from EE to IU is 0.113, with a t-value of 3.138. Although the path coefficient of this relationship is relatively low, prior studies have still accepted as long as the t-value is significant. Therefore, hypothesis is supported. Accordingly, the results suggest that EE has a positive impact on IU. The same results are obtained for the next hypothesis. EE has a positive effect on MT (\u03b2 = 0.116 and t = 2.212). Therefore, hypothesis is supported. Thus, this study reveals that EE has a positive and significant association with MT. The next hypothesis is concerned with the relationship between SI and IU. In this study, the effect of IS is found to be significantly associated with IU (\u03b2 = 0.085 and t = 2.710 with p < 0.01). Even though the path coefficient is low, the t-value is significant; therefore, hypothesis is supported. As a result, it can be suggested that a customer\u2019s perspective on SI has a significant relationship with IU. The hypothesis  examines the relationship between SI and MT. This study finds that the path coefficient (\u03b2) from social influence to motivation is 0.331 with a t-value of 9.479. Therefore, this hypothesis also is supported. Thus, it can be inferred that there is a significant positive relationship between SI and MT. The next hypothesis investigates the influence of FC on EU. This study finds that the influence of FC on EU is not statistically significant. The path coefficient (\u03b2) from facilitating conditions to customers\u2019 use behaviour is \u22120.041 with a t-value of 1.230. Therefore, this hypothesis is not supported. The next two hypotheses are concerned with FC\u2019 relationship with EE and OE, respectively. The results suggest support for both hypotheses. FC have a positive effect on both EE (\u03b2 = 0.164 and t = 4.286) and OE (\u03b2 = 0.218 and t = 6.589). Although the path coefficient of the link between FC and EE is relatively low (\u03b2 = 0.164), prior studies have still accepted such a situation as long as the t-value is significant. Therefore, these hypotheses are supported. Hence, it can be inferred that FC have a positive effect on both EE and OE. For the next two hypotheses, there is a negative effect of PC upon IU and MT. The results show that the effect of PC on both IU (\u03b2 = 0.027; t = 0.705) and MT (\u03b2 = \u22120.012; t = 0.139) are not statistically significant. Therefore, these hypotheses are not supported. The next hypothesis proposes that there is a positive relationship between TW and IU. This relationship is shown to be insignificant. The path coefficient (\u03b2) from trustworthiness to intention to use is 0.017 with a t-value of 0.434. Therefore, hypothesis is not supported. The next hypothesis investigates the impact of TW on a MT. This study finds that there is, indeed, a positive relationship between TW and MT (\u03b2 = 0.511 and t = 3.843). Hence, this study finds that TW has a positive influence on the MT. The next two hypotheses investigate the positive effects of TW on EE and OE, respectively. The study finds that TW has an influence on both EE and OE. The results supported both hypotheses: (\u03b2 = 0.536 and t = 15.260) and (\u03b2 = 0.511 and t = 15.364). As a result, it can be stated that TW has a positive and significant impact on both EE and OE. The next hypothesis explores the influence of OE on IU. The relationship between OE and IU has a path coefficient (\u03b2) of 0.160 with t-value of 3.907. Although the path coefficient of this rela tionship is relatively low, prior studies have accepted similar relationships as long as the t-value is significant. Therefore, hypothesis is supported. As a result, it can be inferred that OE has a positive effect on IU. The same result is obtained for hypothesis which expected a positive relationship between OE and MT. The results of the relationship between outcome expectancy and motivation produced a path coefficient (\u03b2) of 0.267 with t-value of 6.180. Therefore, hypothesis is supported. Hence, this study finds that OE influences MT. The next hypothesis proposes that MT and IU would have a positive relationship. The study finds that the influence of MT on IU is statistically significant. The path coefficient (\u03b2) from MT to IU is 0.368 with t-value of 9.018. Therefore, the notion that there is a positive and significant relationship between MT and IU is supported. Similarly, the results also support hypothesis that predicts a positive relationship between MT and EU. This study finds that this relationship is statistically significant. The path coefficient (\u03b2) from MT to EU is 0.097 with a t-value of 1.986. The path coefficient is low, but, because the t-value is significant, hypothesis is accepted and supported. Thus, it can be suggested that MT has a significant positive effect on EU. Hypothesis is concerned with the influence of IU on EU. As expected, the study finds that it is statistically significant (\u03b2 = 0.429 and t = 10.967). Hence, it can be stated that there is a significant positive relationship between IU and EU."

    "text": "The results of the structural model are presented in figure. Accountants\u2019 participation in strategic decision making processes is positively associated with strategy type prospector/defender and deliberate strategy formulation. SMA usage is positively associated with three of the four contingent factors (strategy type prospector/defender, deliberate strategy formulation, and company size), and also accountants\u2019 participation in strategic decision making processes (explaining 62% of the variation in SMA usage). With respect to the relationship between SMA usage and performance, SMA usage exhibits a statistically significant positive relationship, while accountants' participation in strategic decision making processes is not significantly related to performance. Performance is also directly influenced by the contingent factor market orientation. In combination, the variables appraised explain 71% of the variation of performance. The structural model indicates that SMA usage is not associated with market orientation, although in the measurement model there is a relatively strong correlation between the two constructs. This can be explained by the very strong direct relationship between market orientation and performance which undermines the indirect effect via SMA usage. It is also interesting that accountants' participation in strategic decision making processes does not directly influence performance, however an indirect effect exists between ccountants' participation in strategic decision making processes and performance via SMA usage. From a holistic perspective, the model is dominated by a very strong direct effect of market orientation on performance. SMA usage is positively affected by the adoption of a strategy type prospector/defender and a deliberate strategy formulation (both directly and indirectly via participation), and company size, while SMA usage, in turn, positively affects performance."

    "text": "The examination of the endogenous constructs\u2019 predictive power shows that Rel Val, the primary outcome measure of the model, has a substantial R2 value 0.668. Prediction of Innovation is higher with an R2 value of 0.728, whereas the prediction of SIS is comparably weak (R2 = 0.273). However, considering the multitude of potential antecedents of strategic information sharing activities, this construct's R2 value is satisfactory. The results in figure highlight the important role of Family Power and Family Experience in driving SIS with path coefficients of 0.372 and 0.299, respectively. In addition, Family Experience has a significant effect on Innovation; however, with a path coefficient of 0.096, this effect is rather weak. Surprisingly, Family Culture has no significant effect on either SIS or Innovation. Further analysis shows that Innovation has a stronger direct effect on Rel Val than SIS (0.477 vs. 0.374). A different picture emerges when also considering the indirect effect of SIS on Rel Val via the mediator Innovation. The corresponding total effect is given by the following equation:Total effect=direct effect+indirect effect=0.374+0.775\u22c50.477=0.744. As is shown, this total effect is much stronger than the direct (total) effect of Innovation on Rel Val (0.477), underlining the important role of information sharing activities. In addition, these results suggest that Innovation mediates the relationship between SIS and Rel Val."

However, the second hypothesis, the impact of internal ALOC and flow on satisfaction, was supported; thus, both internal ALOC and flow had positive effects on retention (internal ALOC \u03b2= .39, t= 2.987, p= .003; flow \u03b2= .38, t= 3.649, pb.01). According to the third hy pothesis, the learning strategies students used in online courses had a direct effect on their flow experience (\u03b2= .32, t= 2.044, p= .041).However, evidence for the indirect effect of internal ALOC on flow\u3000(\u03b2= .24, t= 1.442, p= .15) was not found. As far as indirect effects were concerned, the structural model suggested that the effect of internal ALOC on student retention was mediated by the level of students' course satisfaction and had a direct effect on the remaining internal ALOC. Moreover, use of learning strategies had an indirect impact on satisfaction via flow. Flow exerted an indirect effect on retention through a mediator, satisfaction."

The impact of anxious attachment (the independent variable) on ageism (the dependent variable) was mediated by fear of death. The path from anxious attachment to fear of death was significant (b \u00bc 0.36, p < 0.001). Fear of death had a significant effect on ageism(b \u00bc 0.16, p < 0.001). Fear of death mediated significantly the effect of anxious attachment. The mediation effect for the indirect path leading from anxious attachment to ageism through fear of death was significant (Sobel Z\u00bc 3.06, p < .002). The mediation effect for the indirect path leading from avoidance attachment to ageism through empathy was also significant (Sobel Z\u00bc 6.04, p< .001). In addition, the findings show no direct path between avoidant attachment and ageism, whereas empathy (but not fear of death) mediates between avoidant attachment and ageism."

The human capital is indicated by the social competence, employee motivation, professional competence, and leadership ability. The order of this composition is based on the factor loading between each factor and the human capital. The higher the factor loading, the stronger their relationship is. Similarly, we also can deduce that the structural capital is indicated by the process optimization and innovation, corporate culture, internal cooperation, leadership instrument, information technology and explicit knowledge, and the product innovation. Finally, the relationship capital is indicated by the relationship to the other partners, customer, supplier, and public relationships."

In other words, instead of a direct effect, perceived performance has an indirect effect on overall satisfaction moderated by perceived value.

In words, we can say that the professional competence is an influential indicator for measuring the human capital. On the other hand, the factor loading between the relationship capital and the investor relationship is only 0.14. Comparing to the others, it is the smallest one and therefore indicates weak influence to the relationship capital. It can be concluded this factor loading is not significant and can be omitted from the analysis."

In this sample, siblings and media did not retain their relations to greater identification as a smoker, suggesting that this pathway may be more important after an adolescent has first tried smoking. Having peers and siblings who smoke was related to higher normative beliefs about smoking, but again norms were not associated with smoking intentions. Exposure to peer, parent, and media smoking were associated with endorsement of positive expectancies about smoking, which was in turn related to smoking intentions. In this initiation model, the role of media exposure to smoking seemed to have the strongest association with intentions to smoke through the expectancies variable. This model confirmed the negative relationship between parental media restriction and exposure to smoking in media, in that children whose parents restricted media were less likely to begin smoking. In addition, the model retained the added pathway between peer smoking and intentions to smoke, highlighting the importance of peers in the initiation of adolescent smoking."

The lowest impact on awcons is that of children in the household, while access to info and reason have slightly higher effects. Attidaw significantly impact awcons in a positive relationship. Class has a significant positive impact on awcons in the model. We found a negative relationship between reason and awcons.

According to the findings of this study, it is expected that the more SMEs are active or enter in the markets with high competitiveness, the more they have the willingness to adopt internet advertising. \u201cAdvertising agencies\u201d were identified as the second influential factor in internet advertising adoption. \u201cUser type\u201d as a third influential variable is mostly related to those SMEs intending to develop new products. The fourth variable affecting internet advertising adoption is \u201cproduct involvement.\u201d The nature of a product plays an important role in internet advertising adoption. \u201cGovernment role\u201d is identified as the fifth variable affecting internet advertising adoption. Development of e-commerce is the sixth variable affecting internet advertising adoption. Publishers were identified as the seventh variable affecting internet advertising."

    "text": "A careful appraisal of the path diagram in figure, which also shows the direct effects, reveals, for example, that the no of occupants living in a dwelling has a direct and positive effect on household income ( 0.43), dwelling\u2019s floor area (0.29), household type (0.28) and a direct but negative effect on consumption behaviour (0.01). From the results, it is also shown that there was total effects of the nor of occupants living in a dwelling on dwelling\u2019s floor area. This is mainly due to the fact that the effect of the no of occupants living in a dwelling is mediated through household income. Considering the total effects of different variables on dwelling\u2019s energy consumption, the dwelling\u2019s floor area (0.52), the SAP value (-0.35), the NHER value, the no of occupants living in the dwelling and the household income are the ones with relatively high total effects on dwelling\u2019s energy consumption. This does not mean that the remaining variables do not contribute in explaining energy consumption in dwellings. It is revealed that dwelling age has a total and negative effect (-0.18) on energy consumption, likewise dwelling\u2019s insulation (-0.02) and consumption behaviour (-0.02). However, age of HIH was found to have total and positive effect on energy consumption. The results shown that the total and negative effects of SAP value on energy consumption is ( -0.35) and the total and negative effects of energy consumption on SAP value is (-0.05). This is known as reciprocal causality, and it is one of the major outcomes of this research. That is, as SAP value increases, energy consumption also increases and vice versa."

Specifically, the results demonstrated the indirect effect of boredom on FLRC through cognitive, behavioral, and emotional highlighting the stronger mediating impact of behavior. Likewise, the indirect effect of enjoyment on FLRC via cognitive, behavioral, and emotional stressed the stronger mediating role of cognitive. Finally, the indirect effect of anxiety on FLRC through cognitive, behavioral, and emotional indicated the stronger mediating impact of cognitive. Taken together, boredom and enjoyment revealed to have a larger indirect effect on FLRC than anxiety."

Specifically, satisfaction of autonomy predicted SNOLO, and SNOLO, in turn, predicted CLDP, showing a modest effect size. Furthermore, satisfaction of autonomy negatively predicted language anxiety; language anxiety, in turn, predicted a decrease in SNOLO; and SNOLO, in turn, predicted CLDP, representing a small effect size. These indirect effects were also supported by the total effect of autonomy on the outcome, indicating a modest effect size. Similarly, satisfaction of competence was only indirectly associated with CLDP through the mediation process of SNOLO, representing a modest effect size. The total effect of competence on CLDP was also significant, indicating a modest effect size. Moreover, it was noticed that only satisfaction of autonomy was negatively linked to language anxiety, which then linked to CLDP through SNOLO, indicating a small effect size."

This means that consumer\u2019s attitude towards science and technology does have a positive and important influence on its perceived benefits of science and technology (0.5). The opposite takes place when considering attitudes towards the environment (-0.21). The estimation of path coefficients from perceived benefits of science and technology to attitudes towards biotechnology reveals that there is a positive relation among these two constructs (0.73). Finally, the assumptions that a positive attitude towards biotechnology implies a better acceptance of GM medical applications and major GM food benefit perception were also supported (0.45 and 0.68). In contrast, a negative relation among attitudes towards GM medical applications and perceived benefits of GMF was not supported."

    "text": "It can be concluded that the effect sizes of perceived disturbance and perceived control and coping capacity on noise annoyance, 0.54 and \u22120.50, respectively, are quite similar. The effects of noise annoyance on perceived disturbance and perceived control and coping capacity, 0.90 and 0.94, respectively, are also of the same magnitude. It can be concluded that to a large extent, the reciprocal effects between noise annoyance and perceived disturbance and noise annoyance and perceived control and coping capacity cancel each other out. The only significant determinant of perceived disturbance is the level of noise exposure. However, the effect size of 0.04 can be qualified as small. The significant determinants of the perceived level of control and coping capacity are the negative attitude toward noise source authorities and the noise policy (\u22120.22), the negative expectations related to noise development (\u22120.42), the concern about negative health effects of noise and pollution (\u22121.15), and the concern about property devaluation (\u22120.15). Especially, the concern about negative health effects has a large effect on the capacity of people to handle the noise situation. The positive social evaluation of noise source (\u22120.40), the belief that noise can be prevented (0.24), and annoyance related to non-noise effects (0.11) influence the negative attitude toward noise source authorities and the noise policy. The most important determinant of this factor is the positive social evaluation. Only the negative expectation related to the future noise development has both a direct (\u22120.42) and an indirect effect (0.35*\u2212 0.22=\u22120.077) on the perceived level of control and coping capacity."

However, the structural component is represented by the path between latent variables. The relationship between investors\u2019 rationality and biased self-attribution is statistically significant. According to the estimates of the structure parameters (i.e. standardized path coefficients = 0.62; 0.42), if the investors\u2019 rationality increases by one standard deviation, the biased self-attribution and overconfidence behaviour increases by a standard deviation of 0.62 and 0.42, respectively. This implies that the investors\u2019 rationality can accurately predict the degree of biased self-attribution and overconfidence. In other words, the investors\u2019 rationality influences the biased self-attribution and overconfidence behaviour significantly."

ICT positive emotions positively predicted autonomous motivation (\u03b2 = 0.16). Similarly, satisfaction with support positively predicted autonomous motivation (\u03b2 = 0.25). Finally, autonomous motivation was a potent predictor of work engagement (\u03b2 = 0.83). The proportions of explained variance were 22% for ICT positive motions, 42% for satisfaction with support, 26% for autonomous motivation, and 69% for work engagement. Finally, the last step of data analyses was to establish the partial or total mediation between variables. Support for innovation positively predicted autonomous motivation both directly and indirectly enhancing ICT positive emotions and (especially) satisfaction with support. Hence, there exists partial mediation between support for innovation and autonomous motivation. The relationship between digital self-efficacy and autonomous motivation was mediated by ICT positive emotions and (to a lesser extent) satisfaction with support. The effect of ICT positive emotions on work engagement was mediated by autonomous motivation. Analogously, the relationship of satisfaction with support on work engagement was mediated by autonomous motivation. Finally, ICT positive emotions, satisfaction with support, and autonomous motivation mediated both the effects of digital self-efficacy on work engagement and of support for innovation on work engagement."

SE was a significant influence on perceived usefulness (.069) and BI (.096). Finally, FC has a significant influence on PEU (.212) and ATCU (.086). Four endogenous variables were tested in the model. BI was found to be significantly determined by PU, ATCU, and SE. The other three endogenous variables, ATCU, PU, and PEU were explained by their determinants. The most dominant determinant of BI is PU. This is followed by ATCU and PEU. Among the three variables external to the TAM, SE has the strongest effect on BI. TC and FC have little effects on BI. For ATCU, the prominent determinants are PU and PEU. The strong relationship between PU and PEU is demonstrated by the latter being the prominent determinant of the former. For PEU, the dominant determinant is TC which is entirely a direct effect. Of the four endogenous variables, ATCU has the greatest amount for variance account by its determinants. This is largely due to the effects contributed by PU and PEU, thus stressing the importance of the relationship among these three variables."

    "text": "Results partially support hypotheses as challenge appraisal and examining core beliefs had moderate positive relationships with PTG and intrusive rumination and peer support factors had small positive relationships with PTG. Hypotheses were not fully supported in that resilience, cancer-related distress, social constraints, and deliberate rumination were not directly related to PTG. Cancer-related distress and intrusive rumination were related to social constraints; however, contrary to predictions, social constraints within close relationships did not play a significant direct role in perceived PTG. As indicated by the significant relationship between peer support factors and PTG, it may be that for this cohort of participants, peers were more relevant to PTG in this context. Although direct relationships were not evident from resilience and cancer-related distress to PTG, small indirect effects were found. Small indirect relationships were also evident between challenge appraisal and examining core beliefs with PTG. As seen in figure, multiple potential pathways were evident between these variables and growth. For example, in regard to resilience and PTG, lower resilience was associated with higher dis tress, which was related to higher intrusive rumination and examining core beliefs, which in turn were both associated with greater PTG. On the other hand, resilience was associated with connection to peers and seeking information and experiences relating to peers, which was related to higher PTG. Another possible indirect pathway showing moderate coefficients, suggests that resilience was related to greater challenge appraisal, which was then associated with higher levels of PTG."

In terms of the relationship between sound and visual perceptions, visual quality had a positive influence on the eventfulness and pleasantness of the soundscape in urban recreational space.

Finally, there was also a significant direct relation of parental educational expectations to standardized achievement ( .32) for European Americans. Family income had  a slightly stronger total effect for the European Americans."

Parental smoking was not associated with identification as a smoker in this sample. All four social influence factors were associated with increased normative beliefs about smoking. However, increased norms were not associated with intentions to smoke. As hypothesized, higher levels of peer smoking, parental smoking, and media exposure to smoking were each associated with increased endorsement of positive expectancies about smoking, which was related to intentions to smoke. On the other hand, sibling smoking was not associated with expectations about smoking. Finally, the independent pathway added to the model from peer smoking to smoking intentions underscores the importance of peers as a particularly valuable source of social comparison with regard to smoking."

The personal norms construct is the determining factor contributing the highest impact on the binning behaviour (0.503), followed by perceived behavioural control (0.200), and social norms (0.164), respectively. The association between awareness of consequences and personal norms had the highest standardised path weight of 0.651. In other words, the strongest effect originates from awareness of consequences to personal norms. Regarding indirect effects, both awareness of consequences and social norms had a positive significant impact on binning behaviour. Likewise, other than awareness of consequences to binning behaviour through attitude, the results of specific indirect effects of awareness of consequences and social norms to binning behaviour through personal norms showed that these effects were not significant. Figure displays the results of direct and indirect effects."

One should also note that Media 2 exerts an influence on Emotional feelings, which, in turn, influence the Epistemic issues and Candidate image. This means that there is an indirect influence of broadcast messages on cognitive domains where Emotional feelings distort the perceived messages. Furthermore, three cognitive domains \u2013 Social imagery, Current events, and Candidate images \u2013 influence the manner in which Media 1 are perceived. As much as Social imagery and Current events increase the importance of the Media 1, the Candidate image diminishes it."

In winter, people would feel less comfortable in winter if they perceived weak solar radiation, low air temperature, high wind speed or low humidity (r = 0.413). Microclimatic conditions (i.e. a latent variable formed by grouping air temperature (r = 0.609), solar radiation (r = 0.485), wind speed (r = -0.182)) did not display a direct relationship with thermal comfort, but instead only displayed an indirect relationship with thermal comfort via thermal sensation. Thermal comfort was mostly influenced by thermal sensation. An individual\u2019s thermal acceptability was shown to be influenced by the thermal comfort perceived (r = 0.567) and thermal sensation (r = 0.201). In addition, thermal acceptability could also be improved by having more trees, water ponds or shade provisions immediately visible in summer (r = 0.115, 0.088 and 0.042)."

S2, S3, S4, and S6 shall be considered for the social factoris. Political factors is represented by the P1, P2, and P3. Finally, existing staff issues shall be measured by the O1, O2, and O4. As for stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction on PPP projects, decision makers should measure the achievement of the following perfor mance indicators: SAT2, SAT3, SAT7,SAT11, SAT12, and SAT13. Among the five categories of evaluation factors for project feasibility, the technical factors and social factors (standardized coefficients = 0.75 and 0.48, respectively) are more important than the others. Greater efforts should be made to evaluate the technical and social viability when conducting feasibility studies for PPP projects. The SEM also showed a strong relationship between the project feasibility of a PPP project and stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction on the project (standardized coefficient = 0.68). The relationship between the technical factors and stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction can be obtained by multiplying the two standardized coefficients (0.75 \u00d7 0.68 = 0.51). The correlation coefficient between the social factors and stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction can be derived in similar fashion (0.48 \u00d7 0.68 = 0.33). All the five categories were shown to be intercorrelated to some degrees. Strong interrelations were found between political and financial and economic factors; social and existing staff factors; as well as technical and financial and economic factors."

    "text": "The main hypotheses of the research have been accepted. On the other hand, the SEM analysis and the loading factors confirmed that the basic flexibility has a meaningful impact on potential flexibility. The potential flexibility has a powerful impact on actual flexibility. The potential flexibility also had a direct impact on static complexity. The acceptance of all three main hypotheses of the research yields to the following practical implications. First of all, it was recognized that there is cause and effect relations among flexibility dimensions. This means that if we would like to improve the actual flexibility as emergent flexibility of a manufacturing system, we may invest on potential flexibility dimensions. Moreover, potential flexibility has a strong root in basic flexibility. These interactions help the managers to plan the improvement projects of manufacturing systems effectively. These interactions can be followed in the lowest level of indicators of the flexibility dimensions for more practical suggestions through path analysis as accomplished in this research. We also find that static complexity receives a direct impact from potential flexibility. This chain, i.e. the serial impacts of flexibility dimensions and the static complexity help managers to tune the manufacturing systems on the basis of these perspectives."

Of  the  four  determinants,  socioeconomic  status  is  the strongest predictor (factor loading = 0.71). Households with improved socioeconomic status usually indicate that they are also financially  advantaged. The  next  predictor  is  income  (factor  loading = 0.68).  This  indicates  that  those  with malnutrition  are  more  likely  to  belong  to  a  low  income group. The number of rooms in the home was the weakest predictor for  malnutrition  (factor  loading = 0.46)."

    "text": "From the estimation value of path coefficients in figure, it is understood that the gender, age, occupation, annual income and trading experience play the most important role in explaining the difference of biased self-attribution. Analysis of the results indicates that occupation and trading experience have a positive impact on both biased self-attribution and overconfidence behaviour. The results indicate that investors who have relatively less trading experience are subjected to biased self-attribution making them more overconfident. Even though biased self-attribution leads to overconfidence, the average levels of overconfidence are greatest in those individuals who have been trading for a short time. With more experience, people develop better self-assessments. On the other hand, age and annual income have a negative impact on both biased self-attribution and overconfidence behaviour. It is understood from the results that the young investors are subjected to biased self-attribution and overconfidence. From figure, it is understood that there is a negative relationship between gender and both biased self-attribution (-0.14) and overconfidence (-0.16). It is observed that financial education/certification (0.09) influences the overconfidence behaviour but does not impact the biased self-attribution. It implies that educated investors slightly tend towards overconfidence. This indicates that even the financial education could cause harm, in that it fosters overconfidence. Finally, the evidence from the structural model shows a strong relationship between biased self-attirbution and investor\u2019s personal characteristics, particularly gender, age, occupation, annual income and trading experience."

    "text": "PROV-GOV were found to be more likely to POLICY related tasks (g = .174) whereas FED-REGION were less likely to do so (g = -.312). PROV-GOV were the most likely to examine provincial issues (g = .276) but were far less likely to examine issues on a national basis (g = -.407). Those in the FED-NCR group presented the converse results with more engagement in national issues (g = .161) and less on provincial issues (g = -.297). The fed-region were less likely to national issues (g = -.115). Prov-gov were less involved with both FIRE (g = -.122) and LONG (g = -.274), whereas fed-region were more apt to engage in long (g =.129). The first notable and unexpected result was the very strong effect from POLICY to STREET (b = .446). This strong positive relationship indicates that \u2013 contrary to our expectations \u2013 those who did policy work were also likely to do street level activities, meaning that these positions and tasks were far from mutually exclusive. However, greater engagement in policy activities did imply a greater involvement in provincial (b = .313), national (b = .376) as well as long (b = .191), and FIRE (b = .151) issues. Also contrary to what we expected, the SEM analysis revealed that many analysts who were more involved in PROVINCIAL were also engaged in LONG (g = .112). National issue work also was accompanied with FIRE (g = .132) and LONG (g = .119), again suggesting that these forms of activities are also not oppositional: those who do more of one tend to do more of the other. With respect to the attitudinal variables, however, as expected, those who were actively engaged in FIRE activities were more likely to agree that policymaking was less rational than POLITICAL (b = .164). Finally, those who recognized greater political involvement in POLITICAL also had a very strong sense that CAPACITY was increasingly weak (b = -0.266)."
